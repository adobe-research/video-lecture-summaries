0:00Let's now expand our knowledge of calculus
0:03to the third dimension.
0:05So first of all, just what does a function look like
0:09in three dimensions?
0:09And actually we'll go over the different types.
0:11Because you can have a line in three dimensions, or kind of
0:13a curve in three dimensions.
0:14You can have a surface.
0:15You could have a vector field.
0:18There are different types of representations we'll see,
0:20when we start working with three dimensions.
0:21But I think the most intuitive-- and none of these
0:24are directly intuitive-- I think you have to really be
0:26able to visualize them.
0:28But the most intuitive, to me at least, is a surface
0:30in three dimensions.
