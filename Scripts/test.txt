We've already explored a two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem.	0	45
If I have some region-- so this is my region right over here.	45	135
We'll call it R. And let's call the boundary of my region, let's call that C. And if I have some vector field in this region, so let me draw a vector field like this.	135	300
If I draw a vector field just like that, our two-dimensional divergence theorem, which we really derived from Green's theorem, told us that the flux across our boundary of this region-- so let me write that out.	300	570
The flux across the boundary, so the flux is essentially going to be the vector field.	570	645
It's going to be our vector field F dotted with the normal outward-facing vector.	645	750
So the normal vector at any point is this outward-facing vector, So our vector field, dotted with the normal-facing vector at our boundary times our little chunk of the boundary.	750	915
If we were to sum them all up over the entire boundary-- let me write that a little bit neater-- that's the same thing as summing up over the entire region.	915	1185
So let's sum up over the entire region.	1185	1215
So summing up over this entire region, each little chunk of area, dA-- we could call that dx dy if we wanted to if we're dealing in the xy domain right over here, but each little chunk of area times the divergence of F, which is really saying, how much is that vector field pulling apart?	1215	1530
So it's times the divergence of F. And hopefully, it made intuitive sense.	1530	1635
The way that I drew this vector field right over here, you see everything's kind of coming out.	1635	1695
You could almost call this a source right here, where the vector field seems like it's popping out of there.	1695	1755
This has positive divergence right over here.	1755	1800
And so because of this, you actually see that the vector field at the boundary is actually going in the direction of the normal vector, pretty close to the direction of the normal vector, so it makes sense.	1800	1950
You have positive divergence, and this is going to be a positive value.	1950	2010
The vector field is going, for the most part, in the direction of the normal vector.	2010	2055
So the larger this is, the larger that is.	2055	2100
So hopefully, some intuitive sense.	2100	2115
If you had another vector field-- so let me draw another region-- that looked like this, so I could draw a couple situations.	2115	2265
So one where there's very limited divergence, maybe it's just a constant.	2265	2325
The vector field doesn't really change as you go in any given direction.	2325	2415
Over here you'll get positive fluxes.	2415	2475
I don't know what the plural of flux is.	2475	2505
You'll get positive fluxes, because the vector field seems to be going in roughly the same direction as our normal vector.	2505	2595
But here, you'll get a negative flux.	2595	2625
So stuff is coming in here.	2625	2655
If you imagine your vector field is essentially some type of mass density times volume, and we've thought about that before, this is showing how much stuff is coming in, and then stuff is coming out.	2655	2805
So your net flux will be close to zero.	2805	2865
Stuff is coming in, and stuff is coming out.	2865	2895
Here, you're just saying, hey, stuff is constantly coming out of this surface.	2895	2970
So hopefully, this gives you a sense that here you have very low divergence, and you would have a low flux, total aggregate flux, going through your boundary.	2970	3105
Here you have a high divergence, and you would have a high aggregate flux.	3105	3150
I could draw another situation.	3150	3195
So this is my region R. And let's say that we have negative divergence, or we could even call it convergence.	3195	3285
Convergence isn't an actual technical term, but you could imagine if the vector field is converging within R, well, the divergence is going to be negative in this situation.	3285	3465
It's actually converging, which is the opposite of diverging.	3465	3495
So the divergence is negative in this situation.	3495	3555
And also the flux across the boundary is going to be negative.	3555	3600
Because as we see here, the way I drew it, across most of this boundary, the vector field is going in the opposite direction.	3600	3690
It's going in the opposite direction as our normal vector at any point.	3690	3765
So hopefully, this gives you a sense of why there's this connection between the divergence over the region and the flux across the boundary.	3765	3885
Well, now we're just going to extend this to three dimensions, and it's the exact same reasoning.	3885	3960
If we have a-- and I'll define it a little bit more precisely in future videos-- a simple, solid region.	3960	4065
So let me just draw it.	4065	4080
And I'm going to try to draw it in three dimensions.	4080	4125
So let's say it looks something like that.	4125	4185
And one way to think about it is this is going to be a region that doesn't bend back on itself.	4185	4245
And if you have a region that bends back on itself-- well, we'll think about it in multiple ways.	4245	4305
But out of all the volumes of three dimensions that you can imagine, these are the ones that don't bend back on themselves.	4305	4395
And there are some that you might not be able to imagine that would also not make the case.	4395	4455
But even if you had ones that bent back on themselves, you could separate them out into other ones that don't.	4455	4575
So here is just a simple solid region over here.	4575	4620
I'll make it look three dimensional.	4620	4650
So maybe if it was transparent, you would see it like that.	4650	4695
And then you see the front of it like that.	4695	4740
So it's this kind of elliptical, circular, blob-looking thing.	4740	4800
So that could be the back of it.	4800	4830
And then if you go to the front, it could look something like that.	4830	4890
So this is our simple solid region.	4890	4950
I'll call it-- well, I'll call it R still.	4950	4995
But we're dealing with a three dimensional.	4995	5025
We are now dealing with a three-dimensional region.	5025	5100
And now the boundary of this is no longer a line.	5100	5145
We're now in three dimensions.	5145	5160
The boundary is a surface.	5160	5190
So I'll call that S. S is the boundary of R. And now let's throw on a vector field here.	5190	5385
Now, this is a vector field in three dimensions.	5385	5415
And now let's imagine that we actually have positive divergence of our vector field within this region right over here.	5415	5520
So we have positive divergence.	5520	5535
So you can imagine that it's kind of-- the vector field within the region, it's a source of the vector field, or the vector field is diverging out.	5535	5670
That's just the case I drew right over here.	5670	5745
And the other thing we want to say about vector field S, it's oriented in a way that its normal vector is outward facing, so outward normal vector.	5745	5895
So the normal, it's oriented so that the surface-- the normal vector is like that.	5895	5970
The other option is that you have an inward-facing normal vector.	5970	6015
But we're assuming it's an outward-facing N. Well, then we just extrapolate this to three dimensions.	6015	6090
We essentially say the flux across the surface.	6090	6135
So the flux across the surface, you would take your vector field, dot it with the normal vector at the surface, and then multiply that times a little chunk of surface, so multiply that times a little chunk of surface, and then sum it up along the whole surface, so sum it up.	6135	6465
So it's going to be a surface integral.	6465	6480
So this is flux across the surface.	6480	6510
It's going to be equal to-- if we were to sum up the divergence, if we were to sum up across the whole volume, so now if we're summing up things on every little chunk of volume over here in three dimensions, we're going to have to take integrals along each dimension.	6510	6870
So it's going to be a triple integral over the region of the divergence of F. So we're going to say, how much is F?	6870	7035
What is the divergence at F at each point?	7035	7065
And then multiply it times the volume of that little chunk to sense of how much is it totally diverging in that volume.	7065	7215
And then you sum it up.	7215	7230
That should be equal to the flux.	7230	7245
It's completely analogous to what's here.	7245	7275
Here we had a flux across the line.	7275	7320
We had essentially a two-dimensional-- or I guess we could say it's a one-dimensional boundary, so flux across the curve.	7320	7470
And here we have the flux across a surface.	7470	7500
Here we were summing the divergence in the region.	7500	7545
Here we're summing it in the volume.	7545	7560
But it's the exact same logic.	7560	7590
If you had a vector field like this that was fairly constant going through the surface, on one side you would have a negative flux.	7590	7680
On the other side, you would have a positive flux, and they would roughly cancel out.	7680	7725
And that makes sense, because there would be no diverging going on.	7725	7770
If you had a converging vector field, where it's coming in, the flux would be negative, because it's going in the opposite direction of the normal vector.	7770	7875
And so the divergence would be negative as well, because essentially the vector field would be converging.	7875	7965
So hopefully this gives you an intuition of what the divergence theorem is actually saying something very, very, very, very-- almost common sense or intuitive.	7965	8115
And now in the next few videos, we can do some worked examples, just so you feel comfortable computing or manipulating these integrals.	8115	8205
And then we'll do a couple of proof videos, where we actually prove the divergence theorem.	8205	8295
