\subsection{Comprehension Task}
\cite{monserrat2014live}: 10-question pre-test and 10-question post-test. The two sets of questions test the same type of knowledge but were asked in a different ways (e.g. one question would be asked in identification form with a why question after, and the other question would be in essay form). Measured test scores and learning time.
