\subsection{Time-stamped Transcript}
Several on-line video lectures (e.g. Khan Academy) come with transcripts. In cases where transcripts were not provided, we used an on-line audio transcription service to acquire a verbatim text transcript. Then, we used a tool from \cite{rubin2013content} to compute an alignment between the video's audio file and the transcript. The final output is a time-stamped transcript, where each word is annotated with a start and end time.
