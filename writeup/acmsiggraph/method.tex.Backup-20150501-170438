\section{Method}
\subsection{Time-stamped Transcript}
Several on-line video lectures (e.g. Khan Academy) come with transcripts. In cases where transcripts were not provided, we used an on-line audio transcription service to acquire a verbatim text transcript. Then, we used a tool from \cite{rubin2013content} to compute an alignment between the video's audio file and the transcript. The final output is a time-stamped transcript, where each word is annotated with a start and end time.

\subsection{Stroke Extraction}
A \textit{stroke} is defined as the set of foreground pixels that is drawn during one continuous drawing activity. The method used to extract strokes from video frames are similar to that used by \cite{monserrat2013notevideo} to extract visual objects in their NoteVideo interface. Figure~\ref{Fig:stroke_examples} shows examples of extracted strokes from different videos. A typical stroke comprises several characters to several words, or it can also be a part of other drawings such as a graph (Figure~\ref{Fig:stroke_examples}c).

\end{figure}

\subsection{Hierarchical Grouping of Strokes}
We group strokes into hierachical units: lines and sentence-strokes.  
A line consists of a set of strokes that \textit{belong together} semantically. For example, a line could be a single row of equations, or a graph including its labels.
