  in last video we
  the assumptions that are made when we consider
  theory and there
  key assumptions the first is the cause morjera principle which says that
  on large enough scales large
  scales the universe is
  both homogeneous which means it looks the same at all points
  and isotropic so there's no special directions in the univers
  an hour second assumption was that
  all the laws of physics that we have studied and come to understand
  are valid everywhere in the universe and for the purposes
  stating the Big Bang probably the most important law
  a physics is general tivity and general to be is
  feinstein's theory of gravity but incentive
  describing gravity as a pulling force eisenstein describes gravity as
  the fact love matter and energy actually
  curving space-time and
  when you have a curved spacetime the curvature of that space time will
  actually tell
  matter in energy how to move and how to flow
  and in this picture one of the most important things is that
  space is not just some fixed background
  that matter and energy move around on rather
  space-time will actually take a dynamical me
  and involve rate along with matter and energy as the universal
  so it's going to be very important for us to understand
  the geometry of the space-time so good place to start from here
  is saying well if the geometry of space is going to be so important
  what kinds of geometry scan I have
  that satisfy the cosmological principle I'm geometry is gonna have that are both
  homogeneous and isotropic and for the purposes
  simplicity we're just going to you start by considering some
  two-dimensional surfaces two dimensional spaces
  and by considering the spaces will learn the general properties that
  some of these different geometries can have and
  the are very now very analogous cases to
  three dimensional spaces your universe has three dimensions so
  book the lessons we learned looking at two dimensional spaces
  all right through to the 3d is to the first
  tape up space that we can have is probably one that were most comfortable
  with
  the idea I love just say on infinite flat planes
  let's just say I have some
  plane that extends in all directions so this is flat
  its infinite in size in
  and all love the rules have geometry that we've
  learned in grade school still applies so if I draw
  say a triangle on MySpace then
  the angles of that triangle will add up
  to 180 degrees is a rule that
  we've probably all learning public school and probably familiar to most
  it still applies in this case and we notice that
  this space if it's a infinite extent
  is homogeneous there's no special points on here
  and its isotropic there's no special directions now this isn't the only kind
  of space that week
  for example we could consider the surface of a sphere
  drugs year and
  this space will have different geometric properties
  so we would see that this piece is positively curved
  positively curved
  and we noticed that this space
  is actually a finite space there's only so much
  period so it's fine 8 but
  even though it's a finite space it still has no wage too if I were
  two-dimensional person living on this on this two-dimensional surface
  I could walk around and around and never come into any boundary or anything
  and if I look at my
  you know general rules and geometry if I make a triangle
  on this curved surface the triangle might look something like this  
  and this triangle where each of these lines are following
  straight lines on this curved space if I
  sum up the angle said the strike makes then
  the angles will actually some up to you more than a hundred me degrees
  so it's a very different kind of geometry then the flight geometry we're
  used to
  however this geometry is still
  homogeneous and isotropic if I'm living on the server
  on this surface there's no special points and there's no special directions
  still satisfies the cosmological principle
  now there's another table space that I can have and that is
  a negative leakers space in this ones kinda difficult to draw so let's see how
  I do it this
  it kinda looks like this she a sample
  so so we have the Sun or shade and we say this has
  negative curvature negative the
  occur this space like the
  plane would be infinite incise
  extending these directions 0 as far as you wanna go
  but when I look at a a triangle on this shape
  following straight lines on the skirt space the triangle might look something
  like this  
  and the angles have that triangle would add up to you
  less than a hundred need degrees so again we have a different type
  geometry with this geometry is also going to be
  homogeneous and isotropic so it's still on the ballot possibility for
  for the shipper for universe now there are
  other geometry SEDAR that are out there that could exist
  for instance I could have and service fear I could have some sort of
  egg shape but we notice when looking at this
  X shape that the curvature at the at the very top of the egg
  is going to be different than the curvature on the side of the eggs signs
  of the eggs
  are the Aggies much more flattened the very
  in the very tip so that means these two points
  are going to be different and that goes against
  our are a cosmological principle this space would not be homogeneous anymore
  either
  differences between spaces so even though we could have
  other geometries these are the only three
  kinds of geometry that we can have for the universe
  that are both homogeneous and isotropic
  and in order to identify Witcher the shapes
  actually describes our universe were alternately going to have to go
  and measure something to you identify which type it is but we'll talk about
  that serve thing later now looking at these two
  curved geometry is you might be saying well
  these can actually describe what the universe looks like I can you know
  get to friends and a couple pieces a string in and go out and form a triangle
  and measure the angles in a triangle in a notice that the land up to 180 degrees
  like the flat plains ok so this must be unambiguously what are
  with the shipper universes and my response to that would be
  if you look this at the surface
  for instance this fear on very very small spaces
  on very small scales then
  this little patch will appear to be almost flat
  for the same reason that people for hundreds of years thought that the earth
  was flat
  if you're only looking on small scales the
  surface appear seems like it's only when you kinda walk-on
  larger scales that you realize that the year
  is actually round so for all the surfaces
  if you look on smaller scales will appear flat
  but with modern technology and modern telescopes were actually able to see far
  enough
  to begin to test the kinda large-scale
  properties the geometry of our universe
  so if this can a length scale
  is on the order of billions of light-years
  then looking on scales like the earth and the solar system
  you're not going to be able to notice the curvature space on the scales
  now when working with these curved spaces
  there's something that's very very important note   and is a source
  love lot of confusion when it comes to talking about the geometry of the early
  universe
  and that is the idea love when I
  draw this picture just for kinda simplicity in
  in our understanding of this geometry I Drive as
  the two-dimensional surface love a three-dimensional spear
  and the truth is that if I have this
  two-dimensional space I can completely describe
  that two-dimensional space using only the properties
  on that surface without ever having to refer to you
  some third dimension volume this object or
  or anything else it can be completely on its own
  perfectly valid two-dimensional space in is actually fairly easy to describe
  mathematically
  same with this other curb geometry I can completely describe that
  without ever referring to any higher dimensional space
  so when we start talking about universe
  expanding and contracting what we're talking about is
  I have this so homogeneous I'm isotropic geometry
  and maybe that geometry start small
  and then that geometry expands
  into you some into some what we would call
  larger geometry there's more surface area here
  than there is here but what people often want to say
  is that there is some higher dimensional space
  that this object that this surface is expanding into
  but I can describe a love the geometry
  completely staying on this surface without
  ever leaving the service a higher dimension
  does not have to exist in order for this to be
  a consistent theory and when we talk
  more about the expansion of the universe this is the kind of expansion
  were talking about this geometry space itself
  changing and if I have say two points on the surface
  then shipping
  brighter color then if I am cue
  points on this surface then
  as this space expands
  then these two points will appear to be
  further apart it'll take longer for like to bounce back and forth
  and this doesn't just happen for curved geometry so I can have this plan
  geometry
  starting in a a somewhat kinda
  compressed state you can say so so these two points are close together in
  takes like certain amount of time to bounce between knows
  but that geometry through general to be because we said that
  in according to general to be space-time
  can actually evolving changing based on the matter and energy that's in it
  so this piece can actually expand
  and these two points will be
  further the be moved farther away from each other it'll take away
  a longer amount of time to travel between those two points
  but one of the important things to know when we're considering these expending
  geometry is
  is that we do not need to have
  some higher dimension that this thing is expanding into we don't have
  compressed matter and empty space outside this is expanding into
  we can completely describe this simply as
  the geometry this space is changing
  only talking about only using on these
  better on that geometry not any were
  anywhere else here so when people sometimes say that
  the universe is expanding into something that's like saying
  I have bar that has a certain amount of temperature
  and that temperature is is increasing and what is that temperature increasing
  into
  when we talk about it that way this question what is the universe is
  expanding into just
  doesn't make sense anymore so so that's
  very important point that I really want to emphasize
  their does not have to be some higher dimensional space at this is expanding
  into
  and we'll talk a little bit more about how the universe expands
  and what's router fax the expansion of the universe has
  in future videos
