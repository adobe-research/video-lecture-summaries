        "line": "  Conditional probability   is involved with the multiplication rule. The notation   for conditional probability is the probability   of B given   A. So this is it. A straight up-and-down line. So as I said it's the probability   of   event b given a has occurred.   Okay. What's the probability B happening given   that we already know that A has occurred. Now probability involves   a condition called independence. Two events are independent   if the occurrence one does not affect the probability of the occurrence   of the other. Thus they would be independent.    So, when we think of the example we saw with the balls and the urn and we were selecting   two balls from the urn one at a time.   Once we drew the first ball out if we put it back   in then the probability   on our next draw is not affected by   the first withdrawal from the urn because it were back to the beginning. The urn   is just as it was before the first draw if you replace that first ball.   So they would be independent. However,   as we saw with our example with the urn   if you do not put the ball back in the urn,   then there is a change in the probability. It is affected   on the second draw by the fact that you have gotten   the first. So what I am saying is,   when a procedure is with replacement   we have independent events.   If the procedure appears without replacement,   we say we have dependent events.   So our multiplication rule is written.   The probability remember this is A and B.   The word And indicates multiplication rule.   Is equal to the probability of A   thats our first draw. Right. Times   the probability of B given   A has already occurred. So   if they're independent the probability   of B given A is occurred is the same thing   as the probability of B. If they are   dependent events then we do make an adjustment for this   condition. So returning to that example   we had of the urn. And we had   we wanted the probability   of red and white.   We would say well that's the probability that the first one is red   times the probability that the second one was white   given that the first one was red. And remember   when our situation was dependent events,   what we saw was   there were three reds. So the probability   of red was three reds out of 12 balls   in the urn times the probability of white.   Well they're still five white balls in the urn   but now what has changed is that there is only 11   balls total in the urn. So that's the probability   of B given that A has already occurred.   When A occurred one of these balls was taken out and set aside.   And that's where we get any answer point 1 1 3 6. okay.   This was our case I think we called it   well I don't think we labeled them. But that was the second case   where we just mentioned that it was without   replacement. Now with replacement again   if they are if events   are independent.   Then our multiplication rule is the probability   of A and B   is equal to the probability of A   times the probability of B. Only if they're   independent events because be has not been effective   by A. This works for both cuz you'll take that into consideration.   But I'll make a note here that this is specifically use for   dependent events.   okay. are without   replacement.   So let's summarize what were saying here about   independence.   Just call this a independece summary.   Okay.   So these statements are equivalent. These statements I am about to write.   First   A and B are independent events.   Or if that's true that's the same thing as saying   the probability   of A and B   is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B.   That's the same thing as saying they are independent events.   Well why can we say that? Well because the probability of   A given B is the same thing   as the probability of A. And the    probability of B given A   is the same thing is the probability of B.   okay. Don't miss these up. It does matter what order those are in.   the probability that a occurs given that be has already occurred   or the probability B occurs given that A has already occurred.   And you can see how they and found are written    based on independent events. That's what we're saying.   Recall that's what we were saying previously that if they are   independent events the probability that A given B is the same thing as   probability of A.    If they are independent events the probability   b given a is the same thing as the probability of B.   So that's our case with me return   the ball to the urn after that first draw so it makes no difference it's not   changing the outcome   out for the probability of being occurring so these events would be   independent. there's no condition of dependence there.
