0:02conditional probability
0:04is involved with the multiplication rule the notation
0:11for conditional probability is the probability
0:14have be given
0:18and a so this is it
0:21a straight up-and-down line so as I said it's the probability
0:25are
0:30even be these regions that were to happen and how I'm
0:33be given and a
0:38has occurred
0:46okay what's the probability ABI happening given
0:49that we already know pay has occurred now probability involves
0:54a condition called independence
1:07to that sir independent
1:19if the occurrence ev-one does not affect the probability of the occurrence
1:24have the other so to a dancer independent if the occurrence have one
1:37does not perfect
1:44the probability FB occurrence but the other
2:04dust they would be independent then so when we think I have
2:08the example we saw with the balls and the earned and we were selecting
2:13cut to balls from the earned one at a time
2:16once we drew the first ball out if we put it back
2:20can then the probability
2:23on our next draw is not affected by
2:26the first I'm draw withdrawal from the be earned because
2:32it they were back to the beginning be
2:35hearn is just as it was before the first row if you replace that first ball
2:39so they would be independent however
2:44as we saw with our example with the Kern
2:48if you do not put the ball back in the urn
2:52been there is a change in the probability it is affected
2:56on the second row by the fact that you have gotten
3:00the first so what i'm saying is in
3:03when a procedure is with replacement
3:13we have independent events
3:22if the procedure appears with out replacement
3:33we say we have n deep ended defense
3:45so are multiplication rule is written
3:58the probability remember this is hey a year ended be
4:03the word and indicates multiplication rule
4:07is equal to the probability a
4:11thats r for strong right times
4:14the probability have baby given
4:18a has already occurred so
4:24if they're independent the probability
4:27be given a is occurred is the same thing
4:30as the probability be if they are
4:34deep end any ants then we do make an adjustment for this
4:37condition so returning to that example
4:41be had a big turn can we had
4:44we wanted the probability
4:49have red and white
4:52we would say well that's the probability that the first one is red
4:58times the probability that the second lawrence White
5:03given that the first one was read and remember
5:07when our situation was deep enmity vents
5:10what we saw was
5:14there were three Reds so the probability
5:19I've read was three Reds at a 12 balls
5:23in the urn times the probability of white
5:27while they're still five white balls in the urn
5:31but now what has changed is their only 11
5:35balls total in the air so that's the probability
5:40be given that a has already occurred
5:43when a occurred one of these balls with taken out and set aside
5:48and that's where we get any answer point 11
5:51Terry 6 okay
5:55this was our case I think we called it
5:58well I don't think we label them that that was the second case
6:02where week with just mention that it was without
6:06replacement now with replacement again
6:10if they are if events
6:16are independent
6:26dinner multiplication rule is the probability
6:30okay and being
6:33is equal to the probability of a
6:36times the probability abate only if they're
6:41independent events because be has not been effective
6:45by pay this works for both cuz you'll take that into consideration
6:51but I'll make a note here that this is specifically use for
6:54be pendant events
6:58okay are with out
7:01replacement
7:06so let's summarize what were saying here about
7:09independence
7:17just call this a independents M summary
7:30okay
7:31so these statements are equivalent: misstatements about your pic
7:48first
7:50a NB for independent events
8:01or if that's true that's the same thing as saying
8:08the probability
8:11a a and be
8:15is equal to the probability of the day terms the probability p
8:21that's the same thing is think that their independent events
8:25well why can we say that well because the probability
8:29a a given be is the same thing
8:33as the product probability have
8:38a and
8:42probability FB given a
8:46is the same thing is the probability have be
8:49okay don't make these epic this matter what order those are in
8:54the probability that a hookers given that be has already occurred
8:58where the probability be occurs given that a has already occurred
9:02and you can see how they and found are written
9:06found based on independent events that's what we're saying
9:10recall that's what we were saying previously that if they are
9:14independent events the probability that a given be is the same thing as
9:18probability they
9:19if they are independent events the probability
9:23be given a is the same thing as the probability it be
9:26so that's our case with me return
9:30the ball to the urn after that first row so it makes no difference it's not
9:35changing the outcome
9:36out for the probability of being occurring so these events would be
9:42independent there's no condition and dependents there
9:50of
