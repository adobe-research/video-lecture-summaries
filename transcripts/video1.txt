First, we are going to prove that sine to the two x plus cos to the two x equals one This can be proven from the Pythagorean theorem and the definitions of the trigonometric functions, but we are going to do it using Euler's formula. First, use the fact that e to the i x, we know that's cosine x plus i.sinx We also use the fact that, we've got e to the minus i x equals e to the iminus x that's the same thing as cosine minus x plus i.sinminus x Furthermore, since cos is an even function, cosine minus x equals cosine x and since sine is an odd function, sinminus x is minus sinx We write the negative out in front of the i

Next, we are going to multiply together these two equations right here. We have e to the i x . e to the minus i x equals cosine minus x plus i.sinminus x cosine x minus  i.sine x Now, on the left hand side, add the same base, these exponents we will add them together, get zero for an x by e to the zero is one. On the right hand side, multiplying together the first two terms, we get cos to the two x multiplying together the outside terms, we get minus i.cosine x sine x then multiplying together the inside terms, we are going to get a plus i.sine x cosine x Finally, multiplying together the two last terms, we are going to get a minus i to the two sine to the two x

Now, there is some great cancellation which happens, these two terms cancel out, and this minus i to the two i to the two is minus one, minus minus one is positive one. What we are left with is one equals cos to the two x plus sine to the two x which was exactly what we hoped to get up above. That's just the first way you can use Euler's formula to come up with a more algebraic proof, prove a few more results similarly.

For instance, I'd like to prove the Angle Sum formulas, a hard time remembering these sometimes but that's a great reason to remember where formulas came from, and you can always reminus derive them for yourself.

First, say we have e to the ia equals cosine a plus i.sine a also say we have e to the ib equals cosine b plus isinb Now, just like before, we'll take these two equations and multiply them together e to the ia e to the ib equals cosine a  plus i sine a cosine b plus i sinb On the left, it's simplified e to the ia plus b, on the right, we'll get cosine a cosine b plus we are going to multiply together the two last terms here, i to the two is negative one, so, minus sine a sinb multiplying the interior terms, in the exterior terms, both can have a factor of i, cosine a sinb we are going to write the i on the outside, now factoring that out, we have a sine a cosine b

Next, I am going to take Euler's formula and apply it directly to e to the ia plus b equals cosine a plus b plusequals i.sine a plus b Now, interesting thing, when two complex numbers are equal, their real in their imaginary parts must also be equal, the real part, this first term is cos a plus b which matches up with this part here, and the imaginary part is sine a plus b which must therefore be equal to this part.

If we write down these two results, we have the angle sum formulas. cos a plus b equals cosine a cosine b minus  sine a sinb and we get the sum formula for sine as well, sine a plus b equals cosine a sinb plus sine a cosine b Furthermore, if you want to get the double angle formulas, that's not too bad, if you let a equals x and b equals x then you will get cos twox that's x plus x equals cosine x. cosine x is cosine to the two x sine x. Sine x minus sine to the two x and sine two x

We are going to have cosine x sine x plus sine x cosine x both those terms are actually the same, so, you get twosinx cosine x Once more, Euler's formula proves to be a handy tool to have.
