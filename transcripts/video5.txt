Hi everyone. This is lesson number twenty-two from a tutorial path on probability and in this lesson we study the uniform distribution. If we have a random variable X that follow a uniform distribution, X follows the uniform distribution with parameters a and b.

Here a and b are the lower and the upper limits of the values that the random variable X can take. A uniform random variable is equally likely to take anybody between it's lower limit and it's upper limit. To explain that, I'm going to draw this graph.

Let's say that's X and then that's the PDF X. You said that random variable X takes value between a and b. Since it's equally likely to take any value between a and b, it has a plot PDF. The PDF is flat. In other words, it's a constant function. We know that the area under the PDF is always equal to one, so that we have valid probability density function.

That means the area of this rectangle here should be equal to one. But we know area is the base times height. We can calculate the length of that height that we need so that the area under this curve, the area of the rectangle is equal to one. This base of the rectangle has a length of b - a.

Therefore, for (b-a)*height should give us an area = to one, which implies that h should be = to 1/(b-a). The value taken by the PDF after the uniform distribution, from the lower limit a to the upper limit b is 1/(b-a). In other words, that's the PDF.

The PDF random variable that follows the uniform distribution a to b = 1/(b-a), for values of X between a and b. Now that we have the PDF, we're going to derive the CDF F(x). Let me actually write it. The CDF is going to be...I'll show you how to get that: 0 if x<a. =(x-a)/(b-a).

If X is between a and b, it's 1fx>b. That's the CDF. We also show that the expected value is (b+a)/2 or (a+b)/2. That's actually the mid point. So it says, since the PDF is plot and constant, the expected value is going to be right at the middle of lower, between the lower limits and the upper limit, which is (a+b)/2 or (b+a)/2.

The variance of the random variable X is going to be equal to (b-a)^2/12. Finally, the MGF, the moment generating function of a uniform random variable, is equal to each of the b*t-each of the a*t/(b-a)*t. The rest of this lesson is going to be showing you how to get this CDF, expected value, variance, and momentarily function.

Let's find the CDF. CDF of a random variable X is equal to the probability that random variable X takes a value less than or equal to little x. Let me actually draw that picture again so that I can explain things better. We have a here, b, uniform distribution takes any value between a and b, equally likely and height or the density function has a value=1/(b-a).

When the value of X is less than the lower limit a, then the CDF is equal to zero. The reason for that is there's no chance that the random variable X can take value less than little x if, little x is less than a. That is because X cannot take values less than a. That's equal to zero.

When X is between a and b, then the CDF is the integral from negative infinity to X of the PDF F(x) tx, but the PDF cannot take any value less than a. Instead of starting from negative infinity, I can set the lower limit of this integral to be a, so that I have integral from a to X of f(x) dX. But f(x) is 1/(b-a), for values of X between a and b.

This is 1/(b-a) du. Now, this integral is equal to u/(b-a), lower limit a, upper limit X. When you plug in the upper limit and the lower limit you get X/(b-a)-a/(b-a). That is equal to X-a/(b-a). That's the CDF for values of X between a and b. It turns out that the CDF...what's the CDF at?

X is equal to b. The CDF and X=b if f(X,b), plug in b in this equation, then you have (b-a)/(b-a)=1. With that in mind, we can actually just write the CDF when X is greater than b. When X is greater than b, the CDF is equal to one. F(x) is equal to one.

I could have actually found that CDF in a much easier way than the way I did with integrals. If this is the point X, the probability that random variable X takes a value less than or equal to little x, is equal to the area of that rectangle. You really didn't need to do the integral.

If you calculate the area of that rectangle, the base has a value of (X-a)*height, which is 1/(b-a), that gives you (X-a)/(b-a). Expected value of the random variable X is the integral overall the support of the random variable X. Let's say the support for X is script X of X*f(x) dx.

We know actually the support is from a to b, any value from the lower limit to the upper limit. X*f(x) is 1/(b-a)dx. 1/(b-a) is a constant just like to X, so I can take it outside of the integral and I have integral a to b, not X, dx. That's equal to 1/(b-a)-x^2/2, lower limit a, the upper limit b.

Plug in the lower limit and the upper limit here. You would find out this is equal to 1/(b-a)*(b^2-a^2)/2. b^2-a^2 is the difference of two squares, which I can rewrite as (b-a)*(b+a) then I have divided by two. So (b-a) cancels out (b-a) therefore I am left with (b+a)/2.

The variance of the random variable X is the second moment minus the first moment square. We know the first moment.First moment is (b+a)/2. We can just find the second moment. And then we use the first moment that we have here to calculate the variance.

Second moment is the integral from a to b. In this case of X^2, f(x) dx. That is equal to the integral a to b. X^2+1/(b-a)dx. Again, 1/(b-a) is a constant with respect to X, so that can be outside of the integral from a to b, x^2 dx. That is equal to 1/(b-a)*X^3/3, evaluated from the lower limit a to the upper limit b.

This is (b-a)*by...If you plug in the upper limit and the lower limit, you get b^3-a^3/3. b^3-a^3 is the difference of two cubes.The difference of two cubes can be written as b-a...revise that from your algebra, if you don't remember. (b-a)*b^2+ab+a^2/3.

Here again, b-a here cancels out b-a up here. Therefore we are left with b^2+a*b+a^2/3. That's the second moment. To find the variance, I need to subtract the first moment squared from the second moment. Second moment is b^2*ab+ab+a^2/3-the square of the first moment. The first moment is (b+a)/2.

This is b^2+a*b+a^2-b^2+2ab+a^2/4. This common factor is 12. 12/3 is four, so we have four times b^2+a*b+a^2-12/4 is 3. So 3*b^2+2ab+a^2. That is equal to 4b^2+4*ab+4a^2-3b^2-6*ab-3a^2. All quantity divided by twelve. Again, 4b^2-3b^2 is b^2.

4ab-6ab is -2ab. 4a^2-3a^2+a^2/12. b^2-2ab+b^2 is (b-a)^2/12. That's the variance of the random variable X which follows a uniform distribution between the lower limit a and the upper limit b.

We found the CDF, expected value, and variance. We're going to go ahead and find the moment generating function. The MGF MX of t is the expected value of e^t*X. That is equal to the integral over all the support of the random variable X, which is from hb and of e^t*X*f(x) dx, but f(x) is one/(b-a)dx.

I can again take one/(b-a) outside of the integral and multiply it by the integral a to b of e^t*Xdx. That is equal to 1/(b-a)*a^t*X/t, lower limit a, upper limit b. That's equal to one/(b-a)*e^t*b-e^t*a/t. When you rewrite this, you will find out that the MGF is e^t*b-e^t*a/(b-a)*t. That's the MGF of a uniform random variable.
