For example, let us say I am having (x-1) into (x-2). What would be the usual process for this?

First of all, I would multiply this x into this x to get x2 -- and I will mention the equal-to-sign. Then I will multiply this x with this -2 to get -2x. Then I will be multiplying this -1 with this x, to get -x. Then I would multiply this -1 with this -2, to get +2.

Later, the next step, x2 remains as it is. -2x and -x makes -3x, plus 2.

The process is really easy, and we could do it in a fairly simple way. But here, there are only two factors that have to be multiplied, so that we could follow this process.

But what if we had some three or four factors to multiply? Let us say I have one more over here, like say (x - 3). What I will have to do is, I will have to put a bracket over here, and I will have to continue multiplying these corresponding things, which actually means that I will have to reach through the step, and then I will have to perform similar operations with these two.

Now, here there were only two terms in one bracket and another two terms in another bracket. Here we are having three terms in the first bracket, and two terms in the latter.

You will see that, as we move down, as the number of factors increases, the number of terms that has to be multiplied also goes up. This makes things really complicated.

There is an easy way to avoid this hassle. Let us see how.

Here, let us generalize this entire process first. We will first derive our results and then see how this pattern actually works.

First of all, your first factor is in the form of (ax + b), and another is in the form of (cx + d), and a third one is in the form of (ex + f). But these three factors, we can derive our results, and we can expand this method, even if you are having say four or five factors, or even any number of factors.

First, I will deal with this part.

So, ax into cx is equal to acx2, and ax into d is adx, plus b into cx is bcx, plus b into d. This forms first bracket, and multiply it by (ex + f). Fine.

Now, simplifying this further, I will get acx2 plus, taking x common, (ad + bc) + bd. Then I get (ex + f).

Now, this thing you need to remember. I will stop over here, and this is a really quick way to obtain the simplified form of multiplication of two factors.

Let's say I have (2x + 1) into (5x + 3). Rather than multiplying things correspondingly, what I can do is, a into c.

Let's look at this. What is a into c? It is a coefficient of x, and c is also a coefficient of x. What we want is x2. In this general form, you can see that when we are multiplying two factors, both of them having x, the highest power will be x2.

What would be its coefficient? Multiplying its corresponding coefficients of 5 into 2 is 10. Fine, 10 plus next lower power would be x. Now, you can update x, (ad + bc). What is a into this term, plus b into this term?

A is a coefficient of x, multiplied by its constant part -- that is the part that does not have variable along with it -- of the second bracket, plus the constant part of the first bracket, multiplied by the part which is the coefficient of the variable in the second bracket.

Take the coefficient of x, that is a, into d. Let's apply it over here. Coefficient of x is 2, multiplied by 3, so you get 6. Then take the coefficient of x on this bracket, so it's 5, and multiply it with 1, so this is it.

Then b into c. What is b? A constant part over here, and...sorry, it's b into d.

What is b into d? Constant part over here, and constant part over here. We just change the color, the constant part over here and the constant part over here. That is b into d. It does not have any coefficient...it does not have x along with it, or I can say it is x to power of 0.

As you can see, it is power of 1.

So, b into d, and it is 3. This should be the simplified form of this.

Let us do it with our usual method, (2x + 1) multiplied by (5x + 3), [indecipherable 0:06:46] the 10x2 + 6x + 5x + 3, which is equal to 10x2 plus six plus five is 11x, plus -- this is a plus sign -- plus 3. As you can see, we can simplify this further as 10x2 plus 6 plus 5, 11 x, plus 3, and x to the 0 is 1.

You're getting both same answer, but this method is really efficient. Now, you might be wondering if every time you have to write this general form. You really don't need to. Let us see how it works, even when you don't write the general form, or you don't go through this above-mentioned generic process.

If you have a number like (5x - 1) and (3x + 2), remember that here it is negative. Here there are two factors, so highest power will be squared, and there will be some coefficient of it. It will be 5 into 3, 15.

Then, next power will be x. What will be its coefficient? 5, that is coefficient of x in the first bracket, and the constant part in the second is 5 into 2 is 10. Then, constant part of first bracket, multiplied by the coefficient of x in second, it is -3 because here it's -1.

Put addition sign over here.

Plus...now you have to multiply the two constant parts, -1 into 2. That is -2, so what we get is 15x2 -- 10-3 -- 7x, minus 2. Just verify yourself with your usual procedure and you will end up with the same answer.

What if we have one more term over here? As we just saw earlier, we are going to expand this method, and we have this (ex + f), but rather than toiling with this general approach further, I can teach you exactly how to apply this method for three factors or four factors.

I'm not going to expand it any further because we are here to simplify things, and not to complicate it any more. Let us understand direct approach.

Let's say I have (3x + 1) (x + 2) and (2x + 1). These are the three factors that I have, and I want to multiply them. When we are multiplying three factors, each of them having one x, one thing is certain -- that the highest power you're going to get is x3.

How can you obtain x3? Multiply this term into this term, and into this term. What you will have to do is 3 multiplied by 1 is 3, and into 2 is 6, so you've got the coefficient of x3.

The next is x2. When will you get x2? When you multiply 2 terms having x. Here, there is 3 and here there is 1. So, 3 into 1 is 3, and then you multiply that term with this one.

Remember this. Multiply coefficient of x of first bracket with that of coefficient of x of the second, which is 1 in this case, and then multiply that product with the constant part in the third bracket, so 3 into 1 is 3, and further you multiply it with 1, you get 3. Plus...

Then you multiply coefficient of x from first bracket with that of third. That is, you get 6 -- 3 into 2 is 6 -- and then multiply that with the constant part of the second. 3 into 2 is 6, and 6 into 2 is 12.

Then you multiply the coefficient of x, in this case 1, in the second bracket with that of the third bracket, so that's 1 into 2 is 2, and then multiply that with the constant part in the first bracket, so 1 into 2 is 2 and 2 into 1 is 2. You get this.

We got the coefficient of x2. Now, what we did is we multiplied coefficient of x with another coefficient of x, so that here we are multiplying this x into this x, and you got x2, and then you multiply it with the constant term, which does not give any more x, so you remain with the power of 2 in this case.

Let us move a bit further. The next highest power will be x. That is a single x. Let us see how this works.

Multiply the coefficient of x in the first bracket with the constant term of second, so 3 into 2 is 6, and then that with the constant term in the third bracket -- 3 into 2 is 6, 6 into 1 is 6.

Then multiply this 1, that is, coefficient of x in the second bracket, with the constant term of other two brackets. That is 1 into 1 is 1, and then you further multiply it with this 1, so 1 into 1 is again 1, so add one more. Plus...

Coefficient of x is 2, 2 multiplied by this constant term will give you 2. Sorry, this multiplied by 2 will give you 4, and multiply this further with 1. It will give you 4.

Then the constant term is obtained by multiplying all the constants. That is 2 into 1 is 2, into 1 is 2, so this would be your answer...12 -- 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 -- 11, plus 2.

This is the expansion, I can say. Isn't it simple, that you don't ever try and multiply things. You simply add up a few numbers and multiply some small numbers. This method you can expand till any power of x. Try it for x raised to 4 and x raised to 5 for your answer, and just let me know in the comment area if you could get it.

If you can't get it, just let me know so that I can create a video to explain you in an even better way. Thank you.
