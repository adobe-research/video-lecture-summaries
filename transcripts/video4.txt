0:08in last video we
0:10the assumptions that are made when we consider
0:13theory and there
0:15key assumptions the first is the cause morjera principle which says that
0:19on large enough scales large
0:22scales the universe is
0:25both homogeneous which means it looks the same at all points
0:29and isotropic so there's no special directions in the univers
0:33an hour second assumption was that
0:36all the laws of physics that we have studied and come to understand
0:40are valid everywhere in the universe and for the purposes
0:45stating the Big Bang probably the most important law
0:48a physics is general tivity and general to be is
0:52feinstein's theory of gravity but incentive
0:55describing gravity as a pulling force eisenstein describes gravity as
1:01the fact love matter and energy actually
1:04curving space-time and
1:07when you have a curved spacetime the curvature of that space time will
1:11actually tell
1:12matter in energy how to move and how to flow
1:15and in this picture one of the most important things is that
1:20space is not just some fixed background
1:25that matter and energy move around on rather
1:29space-time will actually take a dynamical me
1:32and involve rate along with matter and energy as the universal
1:36so it's going to be very important for us to understand
1:39the geometry of the space-time so good place to start from here
1:44is saying well if the geometry of space is going to be so important
1:48what kinds of geometry scan I have
1:51that satisfy the cosmological principle I'm geometry is gonna have that are both
1:56homogeneous and isotropic and for the purposes
2:00simplicity we're just going to you start by considering some
2:04two-dimensional surfaces two dimensional spaces
2:09and by considering the spaces will learn the general properties that
2:14some of these different geometries can have and
2:17the are very now very analogous cases to
2:20three dimensional spaces your universe has three dimensions so
2:24book the lessons we learned looking at two dimensional spaces
2:27all right through to the 3d is to the first
2:31tape up space that we can have is probably one that were most comfortable
2:35with
2:36the idea I love just say on infinite flat planes
2:40let's just say I have some
2:43plane that extends in all directions so this is flat
2:46its infinite in size in
2:50and all love the rules have geometry that we've
2:55learned in grade school still applies so if I draw
2:58say a triangle on MySpace then
3:02the angles of that triangle will add up
3:05to 180 degrees is a rule that
3:08we've probably all learning public school and probably familiar to most
3:12it still applies in this case and we notice that
3:16this space if it's a infinite extent
3:19is homogeneous there's no special points on here
3:22and its isotropic there's no special directions now this isn't the only kind
3:27of space that week
3:28for example we could consider the surface of a sphere
3:32drugs year and
3:37this space will have different geometric properties
3:40so we would see that this piece is positively curved
3:43positively curved
3:47and we noticed that this space
3:51is actually a finite space there's only so much
3:54period so it's fine 8 but
3:58even though it's a finite space it still has no wage too if I were
4:02two-dimensional person living on this on this two-dimensional surface
4:06I could walk around and around and never come into any boundary or anything
4:10and if I look at my
4:14you know general rules and geometry if I make a triangle
4:17on this curved surface the triangle might look something like this:
4:21and this triangle where each of these lines are following
4:24straight lines on this curved space if I
4:28sum up the angle said the strike makes then
4:31the angles will actually some up to you more than a hundred me degrees
4:36so it's a very different kind of geometry then the flight geometry we're
4:40used to
4:40however this geometry is still
4:44homogeneous and isotropic if I'm living on the server
4:47on this surface there's no special points and there's no special directions
4:52still satisfies the cosmological principle
4:56now there's another table space that I can have and that is
4:59a negative leakers space in this ones kinda difficult to draw so let's see how
5:02I do it this
5:04it kinda looks like this she a sample
5:08so so we have the Sun or shade and we say this has
5:11negative curvature negative the
5:16occur this space like the
5:20plane would be infinite incise
5:24extending these directions 0 as far as you wanna go
5:28but when I look at a a triangle on this shape
5:32following straight lines on the skirt space the triangle might look something
5:36like this:
5:38and the angles have that triangle would add up to you
5:42less than a hundred need degrees so again we have a different type
5:45geometry with this geometry is also going to be
5:49homogeneous and isotropic so it's still on the ballot possibility for
5:54for the shipper for universe now there are
5:57other geometry SEDAR that are out there that could exist
6:01for instance I could have and service fear I could have some sort of
6:05egg shape but we notice when looking at this
6:09X shape that the curvature at the at the very top of the egg
6:14is going to be different than the curvature on the side of the eggs signs
6:17of the eggs
6:18are the Aggies much more flattened the very
6:21in the very tip so that means these two points
6:25are going to be different and that goes against
6:28our are a cosmological principle this space would not be homogeneous anymore
6:33either
6:34differences between spaces so even though we could have
6:38other geometries these are the only three
6:41kinds of geometry that we can have for the universe
6:44that are both homogeneous and isotropic
6:48and in order to identify Witcher the shapes
6:51actually describes our universe were alternately going to have to go
6:54and measure something to you identify which type it is but we'll talk about
6:59that serve thing later now looking at these two
7:03curved geometry is you might be saying well
7:06these can actually describe what the universe looks like I can you know
7:09get to friends and a couple pieces a string in and go out and form a triangle
7:15and measure the angles in a triangle in a notice that the land up to 180 degrees
7:20like the flat plains ok so this must be unambiguously what are
7:25with the shipper universes and my response to that would be
7:29if you look this at the surface
7:33for instance this fear on very very small spaces
7:38on very small scales then
7:41this little patch will appear to be almost flat
7:46for the same reason that people for hundreds of years thought that the earth
7:50was flat
7:51if you're only looking on small scales the
7:54surface appear seems like it's only when you kinda walk-on
7:57larger scales that you realize that the year
8:00is actually round so for all the surfaces
8:04if you look on smaller scales will appear flat
8:08but with modern technology and modern telescopes were actually able to see far
8:13enough
8:14to begin to test the kinda large-scale
8:18properties the geometry of our universe
8:21so if this can a length scale
8:24is on the order of billions of light-years
8:27then looking on scales like the earth and the solar system
8:32you're not going to be able to notice the curvature space on the scales
8:38now when working with these curved spaces
8:41there's something that's very very important note: and is a source
8:45love lot of confusion when it comes to talking about the geometry of the early
8:49universe
8:51and that is the idea love when I
8:54draw this picture just for kinda simplicity in
8:58in our understanding of this geometry I Drive as
9:01the two-dimensional surface love a three-dimensional spear
9:07and the truth is that if I have this
9:11two-dimensional space I can completely describe
9:15that two-dimensional space using only the properties
9:19on that surface without ever having to refer to you
9:24some third dimension volume this object or
9:27or anything else it can be completely on its own
9:31perfectly valid two-dimensional space in is actually fairly easy to describe
9:35mathematically
9:37same with this other curb geometry I can completely describe that
9:40without ever referring to any higher dimensional space
9:45so when we start talking about universe
9:48expanding and contracting what we're talking about is
9:52I have this so homogeneous I'm isotropic geometry
9:57and maybe that geometry start small
10:01and then that geometry expands
10:05into you some into some what we would call
10:09larger geometry there's more surface area here
10:12than there is here but what people often want to say
10:17is that there is some higher dimensional space
10:20that this object that this surface is expanding into
10:24but I can describe a love the geometry
10:28completely staying on this surface without
10:31ever leaving the service a higher dimension
10:34does not have to exist in order for this to be
10:38a consistent theory and when we talk
10:42more about the expansion of the universe this is the kind of expansion
10:46were talking about this geometry space itself
10:49changing and if I have say two points on the surface
10:54then shipping
10:57brighter color then if I am cue
11:01points on this surface then
11:04as this space expands
11:07then these two points will appear to be
11:11further apart it'll take longer for like to bounce back and forth
11:14and this doesn't just happen for curved geometry so I can have this plan
11:17geometry
11:19starting in a a somewhat kinda
11:22compressed state you can say so so these two points are close together in
11:27takes like certain amount of time to bounce between knows
11:30but that geometry through general to be because we said that
11:36in according to general to be space-time
11:39can actually evolving changing based on the matter and energy that's in it
11:44so this piece can actually expand
11:50and these two points will be
11:53further the be moved farther away from each other it'll take away
11:57a longer amount of time to travel between those two points
12:00but one of the important things to know when we're considering these expending
12:04geometry is
12:05is that we do not need to have
12:08some higher dimension that this thing is expanding into we don't have
12:13compressed matter and empty space outside this is expanding into
12:17we can completely describe this simply as
12:21the geometry this space is changing
12:25only talking about only using on these
12:28better on that geometry not any were
12:32anywhere else here so when people sometimes say that
12:35the universe is expanding into something that's like saying
12:40I have bar that has a certain amount of temperature
12:44and that temperature is is increasing and what is that temperature increasing
12:48into
12:49when we talk about it that way this question what is the universe is
12:52expanding into just
12:54doesn't make sense anymore so so that's
12:57very important point that I really want to emphasize
13:00their does not have to be some higher dimensional space at this is expanding
13:05into
13:05and we'll talk a little bit more about how the universe expands
13:11and what's router fax the expansion of the universe has
13:15in future videos
