We are developing a tool to generate summaries of lecture videos. We want to evaulate how  people can use these summaries for different learning goals. people If you take part in this study, you may be asked to watch a video lecture, and/or read a summary of the video lecture. You will be asked to complete a short quiz related to the lecture content as well as a questionnaire at the end of the study.  The study will take approx. 30min. We will be happy to share the results of our research with you. If you are intersted in participating please contact Hijung Shin (hishin@mit.edu).
