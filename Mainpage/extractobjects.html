            <li>Need robust findobject method to exactly match repetitive structure</li>
            <li>In some cases SIFT feature works better- Khan; in others, SURF features work better</li>
            <li>Threshold to compute foreground pixels also depends on video; especially ones with shadows are tricky to handle</li>
            <li>Armando1 and 2: threshold 200, SIFT<br> Khan1: 225, SIFT</li>
            <li>First do exact template matching, then do feature matching</li>
            <li>Removing hand was helpful in case of hwt1</li>
