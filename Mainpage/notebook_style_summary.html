						<h1>Anatomy of the Heart</h1>
						<p>Hi. In this video, I'm going to talk about the anatomy of the heart. And this is just going to be an overview of the gross anatomy of the heart, and the chambers.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>                        
                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_001300.png" alt=""/>
                        <h1>The Heart</h1>
                        <p>So, I'll just draw the heart up quickly here, and I'm going to draw this so that it's being dissected to show all the chambers of the heart, and all the valves.</p>
                    </div>
					<div>
						<img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_001650.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Way Blood Flows Through the Heart (1)</h1>
						<p> So first of all, let's have a look at the way blood flows through the heart. Blood comes into the heart here, and from here, and this comes from the body. This blood then enters this chamber here and flows down through here, then, up through this chamber and out this vessel.</p>						
					</div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_002375.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Way Blood Flows Through the Heart (2)</h1>
						<p>It goes out to the lungs here, and then comes back in through these veins here and here. Then, the blood moves down through these two chambers, and then, back up through this valve and out through this vessel </p>
                    </div>
					<div>
                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_003975.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Labels (1)</h1>
						<p>Now, I'm going to label these vessels now, and the chambers, and the valves. So, these two vessels are the vena cava. This is the superior vena cava. This is the inferior vena cava.

The blood from them goes into the right atrium, and that's this chamber of the heart here. Then it moves through the tricuspid valve -- it's named tricuspid because it has three cusps -- into the right ventricle. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_005175.png" alt="" />
                        <h1>Labels (2)</h1>
                        <p> Blood then flows out of the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve, into the pulmonary trunk.

At this point, it goes to the lungs. Then, returning from the lungs it enters the next chamber via the pulmonary veins. And this chamber it enters is the left atrium. Below the left atrium is the mitral valve. Also, known as the bicuspid valve, because it only has two cusps. Then, it flows into the left ventricle which is the main pumping chamber of the heart. </p>
					</div>					
					<div>
						  <img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_005700.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Labels(3)</h1>
						<p>The blood then flows out through the aortic valve and out the aorta to the body.

Now, I'll just label some other things here. The pulmonary valve is this valve here at the proximal end of the pulmonary trunk. Here is the interventricular septum. This is the septum that lies between the two ventricles. Here is the apex.</p>						
					</div>
					<div>                  
                          <img src="../SampleVideos/more/hwt1/hwt1_framediff_absmin_keyframes/capture_006175.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Labels (4) </h1>
						<p>And finally, here is the aorta. And this is an overview of the anatomy of the heart.</p>

						<h1>Treatment of Emphysema</h1>
						<p>Treatment of emphysema. Just to recap what emphysema is.
Emphysema is a type of lung disease that causes shortness of breath. In a person with emphysema, the alveoli are damaged. The alveoli walls, the elastic fibers are damaged and lost. To look at it as simple diagram, here are normal alveoli. It is not damaged. It still contains the alveoli walls. Alveoli with emphysema, on the other hand, are damaged. The walls are damaged. The elastic fibers are lost, and this makes breathing difficult and uncomfortable.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Now, emphysema is usually not a disease by itself. Many people with emphysema also have chronic bronchitis. A combination of the two lung diseases is commonly called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD. Lung damage from emphysema emphysema and COPD is irreversible. The quality of life for a person suffering diminishes as the disease progresses, which is quite sad.</p>
                    </div>
					<div>
						<img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_002850.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Prevention of Emphysema</h1>
						<p>The most important step in preventing emphysema and COPD, and slowing down its progression, is to quit smoking because smoking is the main cause of emphysema. And another important preventative measure is to also not inhale substances they may harm the lungs. For example, air pollution, or certain fumes.</p>						
					</div>
					<div>
						<h1>Pharmacological treatments</h1>
						<p>There are, of course, pharmacological treatments available out there that aims, um, in reducing the symptoms associated with emphysema, as well as to prevent exacerbations. One of the main drugs used are bronchodilators, the beta-2 agonists. These medications widen the airways, allowing the person to breathe better, easier.<br>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_004830.png" alt="" />
                        <h1>Broncho Dilators</h1>
                        <p>Because, for example, if we take a cross section of the bronchial of this individual with emphysema, the airways are narrow. Because the smooth muscles are contracting, there may be also a lot of mucus being produced here.And so if we administer a beta-2 agonist inhaler, which is a bronchodilator, this will relax the airways, relax the bronchial smooth muscles, which will allow the person to breathe easier. Bronchodilators will reduce symptoms and improve lung function. </p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_006330.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Glucocorticoid Inhalers</h1>
						<p>Glucocorticoid inhalers can also be given to a person with emphysema. And this is to treat the exacerbation periods. These are painful periods when the symptoms are more severe, more prominent.</p>
                        <p>And so, administration of glucoto-, glucocorticoids, uh, which is an anti-inflammatory drug, will decrease the pain cause by inflammation, which is associated with emphysema. So for example, here we have an inflamed lung. And if, and if the person takes glucocorticoids the inflammation will subside. The number of exacerbation episodes, um, will be reduced.</p>						
					</div>
					<div>
						<img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_007200.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Oxygen Therapy</h1>
						<p>Oxygen therapy is an important treatment for people with emphysema if they exhibit hypoxemia. Hypoxemia is when you have low oxygen levels in the blood. And so, um, if an individual has hypoxemia, they require oxygen therapy daily. About 15 hours or more per day. Oxygen therapy can improve survival rates. Vaccines are advised to prevent respiratory infections.</p>						
					</div>
					<div>
                        <img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_008340.png" alt="" />						
						<h1>Vaccinations and Antibiotics</h1>
						<p>Respiratory infections such as pneumonia can exacerbate the symptoms of emphysema. Also, because emphysema is as a result of a chaotic immune response in the lungs, it is necessary that people with emphysema get regular vaccinations. If a person does contract an infection, and is suffering from chronic bronchitis, for example, antibiotics are used to clear up and manage the infection.</p>
						
					</div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_009270.png" alt="" />
                        <h1>Lung volume reduction surgery</h1>
                        <p>Lung volume reduction surgery is used in severe cases. Typically, in COPD. This is where a non-functioning part of the lung is removed. So for example, this non-functioning part of the upper lobule. Removing this non-functioning part of the lung will allow the other parts of the lungs to function better despite being also damaged.</p>
                    </div>
					<div>
						<img src="../Scripts/test_keyframes/capture_009870.png" alt="" />
						<h1>Lung transplantation</h1>
						<p>Lung transplantation can and may be performed in end-stage COPD when lungs are damaged. And the person is failing at other treatments. Donor lungs are given. However, survival benefits has not been demonstrated in emphysema.</p>						
					</div>
                    <div>
                        <h1>Rehabilitation programs</h1>
                        <p>
                        Finally, there is rehabilitation programs aimed to educate people, essentially, about emphysema, as well as improve lung function through certain breathing exercises. Rehabilitation programs also provide emotional support amongst many other things. I hope you enjoyed this video on the treatments of emphysema. Thank you for watching.</p>

                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/khan2/khan2_manual_keyframes/capture_001320.png">
                        <h1 align=center>Problem Statement</h1>
                        <p> Let's say we have a path in the xy plane.
  That's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, in my path
  will look like this. Let's say it looks like that; trying to draw a bit of an
  arbitrary path, and let's say we go in a counter clockwise
  direction like that along our path.
  And we could call this path-- so we're going in a counter
  clockwise direction --we could call that path c.
  And let's say we also have a vector field.
  And our vector field is going to be a little unusual;
  I'll call it p.
  p of xy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>        
  It only has an i component, or all of its vectors are only
  multiples of the i-unit vector.
  So it's capital P of xy times the unit vector i.
  There is no j component, so if you have to visualize this
  vector field, all of the vectors, they're all multiples
  of the i-unit vector.
  Or they could be negative multiples, so they could
  also go in that direction.
  But they don't go diagonal or they don't go up.
  They all go left to right or right to left.
  That's what this vector field would look like.
  Now what I'm interested in doing is figuring out the line
  integral over a closed loop-- the closed loop c, or the
  closed path c --of p dot dr, which is just our standard
  kind of way of solving for a line integral.</p>
                        
                    </div>
                    
                    <div>
                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/khan2/khan2_manual_keyframes/capture_002040.png">
                        <h1 align=center>dr</h1>
                        <p> And we've seen what dr is in the past.
  dr is equal to dx times i plus dy times the j-unit vector.
  And you might say, isn't it dx, dt times dt?
  Let me write that   can't dr be written as dx, dt times
  dti plus dy, dt times dtj?
  And it could, but if you imagine these differentials
  could cancel out, and you're just left with the dx and
  a dy, and we've seen that multiple times.
  And I'm going to leave it in this form because hopefully, if
  we're careful, we won't have to deal with the third
  parameter, t.
  So let's just look at it in this form right here with
  just the dx's and the dy's.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <img src="../SampleVideos/more/khan2/khan2_manual_keyframes/capture_003150.png">
                        <h1 align=center>Rewrite as Line Integral</h1>
                        <p>  So this integral can be rewritten as the line integral,
  the curve c-- actually let me do it over down here.
  The line integral over the path of the curve c of p dot dr. So
  we take the product of each of the coefficients, let's say the
  coefficient of the i component, so we get p-- I'll do that in
  green, actually do that purple color --so we get p of xy times
  dx plus-- well there's no 0 times j times dy; 0 times dy id
  just going to be 0 --so this our line integral simplified
  to this right here.
  This is equal to this original integral up here, so we're
  literally just taking the line integral around this path.</p>
