<p>Good day, and welcome to the Tecmath channel. In this video today, what </p></div><div>

<p>we're going to be having a look at is the fast way of multiplying two, two digit numbers together. So, let's go. So, first of all, we'll see if you can multiply some numbers together. I'll give you a question here, which is 21 times 31. I'll give you, uh, six, seven seconds to work that out. Go. </p></div><div>

<p>So, time's up. Now, if you got the answer is </p></div><div>

<p>651 you did really, really well. You got the right answer. If </p></div><div>

<p>you were busy reaching for the calculator, but couldn't find it in time, well bad luck. You shouldn't need a calculator, 'cause I'm going to show you how to work it out that quickly. OK? So, don't get all despondent if you didn't work it out. We'll go through that, right now. So, I'll show you how to work these out. So, to get the </p></div><div>

<p>first number of our answer, we multiply the first digits in our two numbers here. So, 2 times 3 is 6. There you </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_68000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>go. We got the first part of our answer. We leave a blank space, and then to get the last number of our answer we multiply the last digits of our two numbers here. So 1 times1 is 1. All right, now to </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_94000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>get this middle number here there's a little bit of a trick with this, and to do this what we do is we multiply this number and this number, this number and this number, and we add the answer together. So, 1 times 2 is 2, 1 times 3 is 3, we add 2 and 3 together we get the answer 651. Pretty easy, eh? We'll have a look at another one. So, </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_102000.000000ms.png />

<p>what about 43 times 21. A little bit harder this time. See how you </p></div><div>

<p>go. You know </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_139000.000000ms.png />

<p>the answer yet? I'll go. I'll start working through this one. So, again, 4 times 2 is 8, we leave the blank space, 1 times 3, 3. Then, what we do is we go you remember this? 1 times 4, and we add that to 3 times 2. So 1 times 4 is 4, 3 times 2 is 6, we add those together, and we get the answer of 10. And this leads to a bit of a problem here, and this is a little bit of a trick that you probably want to get. This space here is only one space. It only has space to </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_159000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>fit one digit in. OK? So, the digit that it actually puts in out of this 10 is the zero here. We put the zero there, and this one here, we carry across, OK, and we add it on. So, the answer we end up getting is 1 plus 8 is 903, 903. All good. </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_166000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>I reckon we can go through one more. So, I'll rub that out. Let's have a look at one more question. </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_169000.000000ms.png />

<p>I think this time I want to do it in a nice... this </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_181000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>sort of purple-y sort of color, and I'll do the question here 42 times 63. I'm going all out, using different colors today, getting excited. Go for </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_191000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>it. Ah, I'm getting to excited. I can't even wait to give the answer here. Let's just start working it out, so I can give the first number. 4 times 6 is 24. Leave in a space, </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_196000.000000ms.png />

<p>2 times 3 is 6, and then </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_211000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>what we'll do, and I hope I don't though 'cause I've had to remake this video 'cause stuffed up the answer on this. I'll be honest on this one. Occasionally I get all excited, and I do actually make mistakes too, but for YouTube videos we don't make mistakes. We always get it 100 </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_237000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>percent correct like you guys do. OK? OK, we modify these two guys together. 4 times 3 is 12, 6 times 2 is 12, and 12 plus 12 is 24. We're going to add 24 on. All right. So there's a four there, and a two there. All right. What answer did we get? We get the answer 2,146. Hey, </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_239000.000000ms.png />

<p>that's the right answer. Pretty cool right? </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_241000.000000ms.png />

<p>fast. Your teacher will be utterly astounded about how great you are. I know half you guys probably aren't even going to school, but everyone will be astounded at you guys. People will think you're a genius all right. You don't want to push around </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_256000.000000ms.png />

<p>really well. And yes, you will make a few mistakes, and we all make mistakes. So what I'm going to leave you with lastly is I'm going to leave you with a couple of questions. I'll </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_271000.000000ms.png />

<p>write them up, I'll get you to pause it, </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_275000.000000ms.png />

<p>work through them, and then I'll work through the answers as quick as I can. OK. </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_277000.000000ms.png />

<p>So here they are. </p></div><div>

<p>So 22 times 34, ah 32. Let's see how you go on that one. What about 51 times 63, and what about 82, say, times 51. So pause the </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_301000.000000ms.png />

<p>video, and then I'll get </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_347000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>back to you in a couple of seconds or more we'll go through these. All right, so hopefully, you've worked through those. We'll work through the answer so those right now, OK. So 2 times 3 is 6, and we leave that blank space. 2 times 2 is 4, and then we add 4 and 6 together, which is 10, so we're going to get the answer of 704. OK. There's our answer. The next one, 5 times 6 is 30, leave a space, 1 times 3 is 3, and then we're gonna get the... the number we're gonna be put in here is gonna be 3 times 5 which is 15, 1 times 6 which 6, 15 </p></div><div>
<img src=C:\Users\vshin\Desktop\video-lecture-summaries\Mainpage\tecmath2\capture_386000.000000ms.png />
<h1></h1>
<p>plus 6 is 21, so I'll put that in a different color, so it fits, and it's gonna go 1. This is gonna end up being a 2, so our answer is gonna be 3,230. OK, the very last one. 5 times 8 is 40, leave a blank space, 1 times 2 is 2. And then, what we're gonna do is we're gonna go 1 times 8, we're gonna add that at 10. 8 plus 10 is 18, so... and we're gonna be put 18 here with the 8 there, and the 1 is gonna there. So, our answer is gonna be 4,182. Oh, how we do well on those. I'm gonna see you next time. </p></div>
