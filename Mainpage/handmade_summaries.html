<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We've already explored a two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_000046_000157.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If I have some region-- so this is my region right over here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We'll call it R..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And let's call the boundary of my region, let's call that C..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_000167_000229.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And if I have some vector field in this region, so let me draw a vector field like this..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_000236_000475.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If I draw a vector field just like that, our two-dimensional divergence theorem, which we really derived from Green's theorem, told us that the flux across our boundary of this region-- so let me write that out..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The flux across the boundary, so the flux is essentially going to be the vector field..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's going to be our vector field F dotted with the normal outward-facing vector..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_000662_000918.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the normal vector at any point is this outward-facing vector, So our vector field, dotted with the normal-facing vector at our boundary times our little chunk of the boundary..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_000924_001193.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If we were to sum them all up over the entire boundary-- let me write that a little bit neater-- that's the same thing as summing up over the entire region..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's sum up over the entire region..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_001195_001503.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So summing up over this entire region, each little chunk of area, dA-- we could call that dx dy if we wanted to if we're dealing in the xy domain right over here, but each little chunk of area times the divergence of F, which is really saying, how much is that vector field pulling apart? So it's times the divergence of F..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_001541_002226.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And hopefully, it made intuitive sense..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The way that I drew this vector field right over here, you see everything's kind of coming out..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You could almost call this a source right here, where the vector field seems like it's popping out of there..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This has positive divergence right over here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And so because of this, you actually see that the vector field at the boundary is actually going in the direction of the normal vector, pretty close to the direction of the normal vector, so it makes sense..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You have positive divergence, and this is going to be a positive value..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The vector field is going, for the most part, in the direction of the normal vector..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the larger this is, the larger that is..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So hopefully, some intuitive sense..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you had another vector field-- so let me draw another region-- that looked like this, so I could draw a couple situations..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_002243_003698.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So one where there's very limited divergence, maybe it's just a constant..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The vector field doesn't really change as you go in any given direction..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Over here you'll get positive fluxes..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 I don't know what the plural of flux is..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You'll get positive fluxes, because the vector field seems to be going in roughly the same direction as our normal vector..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But here, you'll get a negative flux..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So stuff is coming in here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you imagine your vector field is essentially some type of mass density times volume, and we've thought about that before, this is showing how much stuff is coming in, and then stuff is coming out..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So your net flux will be close to zero..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Stuff is coming in, and stuff is coming out..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Here, you're just saying, hey, stuff is constantly coming out of this surface..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So hopefully, this gives you a sense that here you have very low divergence, and you would have a low flux, total aggregate flux, going through your boundary..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Here you have a high divergence, and you would have a high aggregate flux..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 I could draw another situation..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is my region R..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And let's say that we have negative divergence, or we could even call it convergence..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Convergence isn't an actual technical term, but you could imagine if the vector field is converging within R, well, the divergence is going to be negative in this situation..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's actually converging, which is the opposite of diverging..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the divergence is negative in this situation..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And also the flux across the boundary is going to be negative..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Because as we see here, the way I drew it, across most of this boundary, the vector field is going in the opposite direction..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's going in the opposite direction as our normal vector at any point..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_003709_004054.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So hopefully, this gives you a sense of why there's this connection between the divergence over the region and the flux across the boundary..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Well, now we're just going to extend this to three dimensions, and it's the exact same reasoning..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If we have a-- and I'll define it a little bit more precisely in future videos-- a simple, solid region..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let me just draw it..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And I'm going to try to draw it in three dimensions..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_004108_004266.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's say it looks something like that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And one way to think about it is this is going to be a region that doesn't bend back on itself..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And if you have a region that bends back on itself-- well, we'll think about it in multiple ways..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But out of all the volumes of three dimensions that you can imagine, these are the ones that don't bend back on themselves..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And there are some that you might not be able to imagine that would also not make the case..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But even if you had ones that bent back on themselves, you could separate them out into other ones that don't..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_004546_004939.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So here is just a simple solid region over here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 I'll make it look three dimensional..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So maybe if it was transparent, you would see it like that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then you see the front of it like that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's this kind of elliptical, circular, blob-looking thing..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So that could be the back of it..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then if you go to the front, it could look something like that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is our simple solid region..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 I'll call it-- well, I'll call it R still..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_005008_005091.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But we're dealing with a three dimensional..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We are now dealing with a three-dimensional region..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And now the boundary of this is no longer a line..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We're now in three dimensions..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The boundary is a surface..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So I'll call that S..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_005200_005370.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 S is the boundary of R..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And now let's throw on a vector field here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_005387_005780.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, this is a vector field in three dimensions..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And now let's imagine that we actually have positive divergence of our vector field within this region right over here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So we have positive divergence..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So you can imagine that it's kind of-- the vector field within the region, it's a source of the vector field, or the vector field is diverging out..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That's just the case I drew right over here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And the other thing we want to say about vector field S, it's oriented in a way that its normal vector is outward facing, so outward normal vector..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_005794_006131.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the normal, it's oriented so that the surface-- the normal vector is like that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The other option is that you have an inward-facing normal vector..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But we're assuming it's an outward-facing N..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Well, then we just extrapolate this to three dimensions..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We essentially say the flux across the surface..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the flux across the surface, you would take your vector field, dot it with the normal vector at the surface, and then multiply that times a little chunk of surface, so multiply that times a little chunk of surface, and then sum it up along the whole surface, so sum it up..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_006180_006769.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's going to be a surface integral..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is flux across the surface..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's going to be equal to-- if we were to sum up the divergence, if we were to sum up across the whole volume, so now if we're summing up things on every little chunk of volume over here in three dimensions, we're going to have to take integrals along each dimension..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_006771_007132.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's going to be a triple integral over the region of the divergence of F..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So we're going to say, how much is F? What is the divergence at F at each point? And then multiply it times the volume of that little chunk to sense of how much is it totally diverging in that volume..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "../SampleVideos/more/khan1/khan1_framediff_objs_threshold_200/negate/obj_007151_008049.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" > <br>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then you sum it up..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That should be equal to the flux..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's completely analogous to what's here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Here we had a flux across the line..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We had essentially a two-dimensional-- or I guess we could say it's a one-dimensional boundary, so flux across the curve..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And here we have the flux across a surface..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Here we were summing the divergence in the region..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Here we're summing it in the volume..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But it's the exact same logic..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you had a vector field like this that was fairly constant going through the surface, on one side you would have a negative flux..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 On the other side, you would have a positive flux, and they would roughly cancel out..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And that makes sense, because there would be no diverging going on..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you had a converging vector field, where it's coming in, the flux would be negative, because it's going in the opposite direction of the normal vector..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And so the divergence would be negative as well, because essentially the vector field would be converging..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So hopefully this gives you an intuition of what the divergence theorem is actually saying something very, very, very, very-- almost common sense or intuitive..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And now in the next few videos, we can do some worked examples, just so you feel comfortable computing or manipulating these integrals..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we'll do a couple of proof videos, where we actually prove the divergence theorem..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">

        <h1>Green's Theorem Proof Part 1</h1>    
        <div>
            <img src="figures/khan2/fig1.png">
        </div>
        <div>
            Let's say we have a path in the xy plane.
  That's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, in my path
  will look like this.
  Let's say it looks like that; trying to draw a bit of an
  arbitrary path, and let's say we go in a counter clockwise
  direction like that along our path.
  And we could call this path-- so we're going in a counter
  clockwise direction --we could call that path c.
  And let's say we also have a vector field.
  And our vector field is going to be a little unusual;
  I'll call it p.
  p of xy.
  It only has an i component, or all of its vectors are only
  multiples of the i-unit vector.
  So it's capital P of xy times the unit vector i.
  There is no j component, so if you have to visualize this
  vector field, all of the vectors, they're all multiples
  of the i-unit vector.
  Or they could be negative multiples, so they could
  also go in that direction.
  But they don't go diagonal or they don't go up.
  They all go left to right or right to left.
  That's what this vector field would look like.
        </div>
        <div id="khan2-fig2"><img src="figures/khan2/fig2.png"></div><br>
        <div id="khan2-fig2-text"></div>
        <div>Now what I'm interested in doing is figuring out the line
  integral over a closed loop-- the closed loop c, or the
  closed path c --of p dot dr, which is just our standard
  kind of way of solving for a line integral.</div>
        <br>
        <div id="khan2-fig3"><img src="figures/khan2/fig3.png"></div>
        <div id="khan2-fig3-text">And we've seen what dr is in the past.
  dr is equal to dx times i plus dy times the j-unit vector.
  And you might say, isn't it dx, dt times dt?
  Let me write that   can't dr be written as dx, dt times
  dti plus dy, dt times dtj?
  And it could, but if you imagine these differentials
  could cancel out, and you're just left with the dx and
  a dy, and we've seen that multiple times.
  And I'm going to leave it in this form because hopefully, if
  we're careful, we won't have to deal with the third
  parameter, t. So let's just look at it in this form right here with
  just the dx's and the dy's.</div>
    
        <div><img src="figures/khan2/fig4.png"></div><br>
        <div>So let's just look at it in this form right here with
  just the dx's and the dy's.
  So this integral can be rewritten as the line integral,
  the curve c-- actually let me do it over down here.
  The line integral over the path of the curve c of p dot dr. So
  we take the product of each of the coefficients, let's say the
  coefficient of the i component, so we get p-- I'll do that in
  green, actually do that purple color --so we get p of xy times
  dx plus-- well there's no 0 times j times dy; 0 times dy id
  just going to be 0 --so this our line integral simplified
  to this right here.
  This is equal to this original integral up here, so we're
  literally just taking the line integral around this path.</div>
        <div>
            <img src="figures/khan2/fig5.png">
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>Now I said that we play our cards right, we're not going to
  have to deal with the third variable, t; that we might be
  able just solve this integral only in terms of x.
  And so let's see if we can do that.
  So let's look at our minimum and maximum x points.
  That looks like our minimum x point.
  Let's call that a.
  Let's call that our maximum x point; let's call that b.
  What we could do is we can break up this curve into
  two functions of x. y is functions of x.
  So this bottom one right here we could call as y1 of x.
  This is just a standard curve; you know when we were just
  dealing with standard calculus, this is just you can
  imagine this is f of x and it's a function of x.
  And this is y2 of x.
  
  Just like that.
  So you can imagine two paths; one path defined by y1 of x--
  let me do that in a different color; magenta --one path
  defined by y1 of x as we go from x is equal to a to x is
  equal to b, and then another path defined by y2 of x as we
  go from x is equal to b to x is equal to a.
  That is our curve.</div>
        <div><img src="figures/khan2/fig6.png"></div>
        <div> So what we could do is, we could rewrite this integral--
  which is the same thing as that integral --as this is equal to
  the integral-- we'll first do this first path --of x going
  from a to b of p of x.
  And I could to say p of x and y, but we know along this
  path y is a function of x.
  So we say x and y1 of x.
  Wherever we see a y we substitute it with
  a y1 of x, dx.
  So that covers that first path; I'll do it in the same color.
  We could imagine this is c1.
  This is kind of the first half of our curve-- well it's not
  exactly the half --but that takes us right from that
  point to that point.
  And then we want to complete the circle.
  Maybe I'll do that, and I'll do that in yellow.
  That's going to be equal to-- sorry we're going to have to
  add these two --plus the integral from x is equal to b
  to x is equal to a of-- do it in that same color --of p of x.
  And now y is going to be y2 of x.
  Wherever you see a y, you can substitute with y2
  of x along this curve.
  y2 of x, dx.
  This is already getting interesting and you
  might already see where I'm going with this.
  So this is the curve c2.
  too I think you appreciate if you take the union of c1 and
  c2, we've got our whole curve.</div>

        <h1>Antiderivative of Hairier Expression</h1>

            
                <div id="eq1-before-text">
                    So, our goal in this video is to   take the antiderivative of this fairly crazy looking expression. Or another way of saying it is to   find the indefinite integral of this crazy looking expression.
                </div>

                <div id="eq1" >

                </div>

                <div id="eq2-before-text">
                    And the key realization right over here is that you,   this expression is made up of a bunch of terms.   And the indefinite integral of the entire expression is going to   be equal to the indefinite integral of each of the terms. 
                </div>
            
            <br>
                <div id="eq2">
                    <img src="figures/khan9/equation2.png">
                </div>
            <br>
                <div id="eq2-during-text1" width=100px >
                    So this is going to be equal to, we could look at this term   right over here and just take the   indefinite, take the indefinite integral of that. x to the 3rd dx.

                <div id="eq2-during-text2" >
                    And then from that we can subtract the indefinite integral of this thing.   So we can say this is, and then minus.   The indefinite integral of 5 times the square root of x d x.
                </div>
                <div id="eq2-during-text3">
                    And then we can look at this one right over here.   So then we can say plus the indefinite integral of 18 square root of x.   Square roots of x over x to the third, dx and then finally, and I'm running out of colors here.  
                </div>
                <div id="eq2-during-text4">
                     Finally, I need more colors in my thing.   We can take the anti derivative of this.   So plus the anti derivative of x to the negative 40th power dx.  
                </div>
        <br>
        <br>
                <div id ="eq2-after-text">
                    So, I've just rewritten this and color coded things.   So, let's take the anti derivative of each of these   and you'll see that'll we'll be able to do it.   Using our whatever we wanna call the inverse   of the power rule or the anti power rule.   Whatever you might wanna call it. 
                </div>
        <br>
                <div id="eq3-before-text">
                    So lets look at the first one.   So we have, we have, what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna find the antiderivative without the constant and just add the   constant at the end for the sake of this.   So we just make sure we get the most general anti derivative.
                </div>
        <br>
                <div id="eq3">
                    <img src="figures/khan9/equation3.png">
                </div>
        <br>
                
                <div id ="eq3-during-text1">
                        So here the exponent is a 3.   So we can increase it by 1.   So it's going to be x to the 4th.   It's gonna be that same purple color.   Or that pink color.   It's going to be x to the 4th.   And we're gonna divide x to the 4th.   So it's x to the 4th over 4 is the antiderivative   of x to the 3rd, and you just had this scaling quantity.   The 7 out front.   So we can still just have 7 out front.   So we get 7x to the 4th over 4.   Fair enough.
                </div>
        <br>
                <div id="eq3-during-text2">
                    From that, we're going to subtract the antiderivative of this.   Now, at first, this might not be obvious that this,   you could use our inverse power rule or anti-power rule here.   But then you just need to realize that 5 times   the principal root of x is the same thing as.   So, this is the same thing as 5 x X to the 1 half power.   And, so, once again, the exponent here is one half, we can increment it by 1.   This is going to be X to the 3 halves.   And then, divide by the incremented exponent.   So, divide by.   Three halves and of course we had this five out   front so we still want to have the five out front.
