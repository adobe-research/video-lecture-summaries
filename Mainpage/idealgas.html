Let's say I have a balloon

and in that balloon i have a bunch of particles bouncing around

they're gas particles

so they're floating freely

and they all have, they each have some velocity

some kinetic energy

and what I care about

what I care... let me just draw a few more

what I care about is the pressure that is exerted

on the surface of the balloon

so I care about the pressure

and <mark>what's pressure? it's force per area

force per area</mark>

so the area here, you can think of it as

the inside surface of the balloon

and what's going to put force,

what's going to apply force to that?

at any given moment i only drew what, 6 particles here

but in a real balloon you would have

you know, gazillions of particles, you know

we could talk about how large, but more particles

than you could really, probably imagine

but at any given moment some of those particles

are bouncing off the wall of the container

that particle is bouncing there, this particle

is bouncing there, this guy's bouncing like that

and when they bounce, they apply a force to the

container, an outward force, that's what keeps

the balloon blown up.

            So let's think about what the pressure

is going to be dependent on.

So <mark>first of all the pressure, the faster these

particles move, the higher the pressure</mark>, right?

Faster particles

faster particles would imply pressure would go up

right? slower particles you're gonna be bouncing

into the container less

and when you do bounce into the container

there is going to be less of a ricochet,

or less of a change in momentum

so slower particles

you're gonna have pressure go down

now <mark>it's practically impossible to measure

the kinetic energy, or the velocity

or the direction of each individual particle

as especially you have gazillions of them

in the balloon

so what we do is we think of

the average energy of the particles</mark>

and the average energy of the particles

you might say oh, Sal's about to introduce us

to a new concept

well I might, well it's a new of looking at a

probably very familiar concept to you

and that's temperature

temperature can and should be viewed

as the average energy of the particles in the system

so i'll put a little squiggly line

cause it's, you know, there's a lot of ways to

think about.. Average energy

or, you know... some, and mostly kinetic energy

right? because these particles are moving and bouncing

the higher the temperature, the more

the faster that these particles move

and the more that they're going to

bounce into the side of the [sic]particle

into the side of this container

but <mark>temperature is average energy

it tells us energy, energy per particle</mark>

            <tr><td>right, if you wanted to know the total, so you know

obviously if we only had one particle in there

with super high temperature

that's going to have less pressure

then if we have a million particles in there

let me draw that

if i have.. if i have..

let's take two cases right here

one is: i have a bunch of particles with

a certain temperature

moving in their different directions

and in the other example i have one particle

right?

and maybe they have the same temperature

on average they have the same kinetic energy

the kinetic energy per particle is the same

cleary this one is going to be applying

more pressure to its container

cause at every given moment

more of these particles are gonna be bouncing

off the side

then in this example, this guy is gonna

bounce —bam— and gonna go and move and bounce bam

so he's gonna be applying less pressure

even though his temperature might be the same

because temperature is kinetic energy, or you

can view it as kinetic energy per particle</td><td>or it's a way of looking at kinetic energy per particle

so <mark>if we wanted to look at the total energy

in the system, we would want to

multiply the temperature

times the number of particles</mark>

and just since we are dealing on the molecular scale

the number of particles can often be represented

as moles, remeber, moles is just the number of particles

so we're saying that pressure

pressure, is well I'll say, it's proportional

so it's equal to let's say, some constant

let's call that R times

(cause we've got to make all the

units work out in the end

I mean temperature's in Kelvin

but we eventually want to get back to Joules

so let's just say it's equal to some constant

or it's proportional to temperature

times the number of particles

we could do that a bunch of ways

but let's think of that in moles

but if I say they're 5 mole particles there

you know that's 5 times 6 times 10 to the 23 particles

so this is a number of particles (n)

this is the temperature (T)

and this is just some constant (n)

constant, right there.</td></tr>

            now what else is the pressure dependent on?

we gave these two examples

obviously it's dependent on the Temperature

the faster each of these particles move,

the higher pressure it will have

it's also dependent on the number of particles

the more particles we have

the more pressure we'll have

what about the size of the container?

the volume of the container?

if we took this example, but we shrunk the container somehow maybe by pressing on the outside

so this container looked like this, but we still had the same four particles in it

the same four particles with the same average

kinetic energy, with the same temperature

so that number of particles is the same,

the temperature's the same

but the volume has gone down

now these guys are gonna bump into

the sides of the container more frequently

and there's less area, right?

so at any given moment, you have more force

and less area

so when you have more force and less area

the pressure's gonna go up

so when the volume went down

your pressure went up

so pressure is going to be, is going to be

we could say, we could say

<mark>pressure is inversely proportional to volume</mark>

so let's think about that
        </p>
        
         <a href="http://youtu.be/WScwPIPqZa0?t=6m12s"><img alt = "idealgas_0651 PV=nRT" src= "idealgas_0651.png" height="300" ></a>

            let's put that into our equation

we said that pressure

sorry, not ressure

pressure is proportional, and I'm just saying

some proportionality constant, let's call that R

to the number of particles times the temperature

(this gives us the total energy)

and it's inversely proportional to the volume

and so if we multiply both sides of this

times the Volume

we get the pressure, times the volume is proportional

to the number of particles times the temperature

and then you know

so <mark>PV is equal to R n t</mark>

and just to switch this around a little bit

        <p><b>Transcript: </b>so it's in a form that you are more likely to see

in your chemistry book, if we just switch

the n and the R term

you get P (pressure) times volume is equal to

n (the number of particles you have)

times some constant times temperature

and this right here is the ideal gas equation

ideal gas equation

and hopefully makes some sense to you

ideal gas (not not gass) equation

they say ideal gas is based on

this little mental exercise I did to come up with this

i made some implicit assumptions when I did this

one is I assumed, I essentially I assumed that

that we are dealing with an ideal gas

and so you say, what Sal, what is an ideal gas?

an ideal gas, is one where the molecules

they're not too concerned with each other

they're just concerned with their own kinetic energy

and bouncing off of the walls

so they don't attract or repel each other

don't attract or repel....

cause let's say they are attracted to each other

then as you increased the number of particles,

maybe they'd want to not go to the side

maybe they'd all gravitate towards the center a little bit more

if they did attract each other

and if they did that, they would bounce into the walls less and the pressure would be a little bit lower

so assuming that they don't attract or repel each other

and we're also assuming that the actual volume

of the individual particles are inconsequential

which is a pretty good assumption

because they're pretty small

altough if you start putting a ton of particles

into a certain volume then at some point,

especially if they are big molecules

it will start to matter in terms of their size

but we're assuming that for the purposes of

our mental exercise <mark>that the molecules have

inconsequential volumes

and they don't attract or repel each other

and in that situation we can apply the ideal gas

equation</mark>, right here.

            <mark>Now we've established the ideal gas equation</mark>

but we're like oh,oh what's R, how do I deal with it, and how do I do math problems

and solve chemistry problems with it

and how do the units all work out

we'll do all of that in the <mark>next video, where i will solve a ton of equations, or a ton of exercises

with the ideal gas equation</mark>

but the important thing, the important take away from this video

is just to have the intuition, as to why this actually does make sense

and frankly once you have this intuition, you should never forget it

you should be able to maybe even derive it on your own.
