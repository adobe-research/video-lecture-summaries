We had this differential equation <font color='red'>here, </font>then we found that it had two linearly independent solutions, e to the t and e to the three t, and we said that the general solution to this differential equation is a linear combination of these two solutions, just a constant times one solution plus another constant times the other solution.

That's exactly what we found up <font color='red'>here, </font>we found that, if we add two solutions that satisfy this differential equation, that the linear combination of them also satisfy it.
