0:01treatment emphysema just to recap
0:04what emphysema is embassy mom is a typable lung disease that causes
0:08shortness of breath
0:09in a person with emphysema Albiol I are damaged alveolar walls
0:15the elastic fibers are damaged and lost so to look at it as simple diagram
0:21here are normal Albiol I it is
0:25not damaged it still contains the alveolar walls
0:29alveolar with emphysema
0:33on the other hand are damaged the walls are damaged
0:38elastic fibers are lost and this makes breathing difficult
0:42and uncomfortable now emphysema is usually not a disease by itself
0:46many people with emphysema also have chronic bronchitis
0:50a combination of the two lung diseases commonly called chronic obstructive
0:54pulmonary disease
0:55or COPD lung damage from emphysema
1:00and COPD is irreversible the quality of life for a person suffering diminishes
1:05as the disease progresses
1:07which is quite sad the most important step
1:11in preventing emphysema and COPD
1:14and slowing down its progression is to quit smoking
1:18because smoking is the main cause
1:21emphysema and another important preventative measure
1:28is to also not inhale substances they may harm the lungs for example
1:32air pollution or certain views there are of course pharmacological treatment
1:39available
1:40out there that ames are in reducing the symptoms associated with emphysema
1:45as well as to prevent exacerbate shins
1:51one of the main drugs used are bronco dilators the B-two
1:54agonist these medications wide in the airways
1:58allowing the person to breathe better easier because
2:03for example if we take a cross section of the bronco love this individual
2:08within the SEMA
2:09the Airways are narrow because
2:12the smooth muscles are contracting there may be also a lot of mucus
2:17being produced here and so if we administer
2:21a beaded to agonist inhaler which is a bronco dilator
2:25this will relax the airways relax
2:29the bronco smooth muscles which will allow the person to breed easier
2:35bronco dilators will reduce symptoms and improve lung function
2:40go quite according halos can also be given to a person with emphysema
2:49and this is to treat the exacerbation periods
2:53these are painful periods when the symptoms are more severe
2:57more prominent and so administration
3:01ugly look glucocorticoids which is an anti-inflammatory drug
3:05will decrease the pain caused by inflammation
3:10which is associated with emphysema so for example here
3:15we have an inflamed lung and a fool
3:18and if the person takes glucocorticoids
3:21the inflammation will subside the number
3:24of exacerbate Shin episodes arm
3:28will be reduced
3:37oxygen therapy is an important treatment for people with emphysema
3:40if they exhibit hypoxemia hypoxemia
3:45is when you have low oxygen levels in the blood and so
3:49um if individual has
3:52hypoxemia they require oxygen therapy daily
3:56about 15 hours or more per day Austin therapy
4:00can improve survival rates
4:04vaccines are advised to prevent respiratory infections
4:07respiratory infections such as pneumonia
4:10can exacerbate the symptoms of emphysema also
4:15because in the same as a result of a chaotic immune response in the lungs
4:19it is necessary that people with into the sea might get regular vaccinations
4:24if a person does contract infection
4:30and is suffering from chronic bronchitis for example
4:33antibiotics are used to clear up
4:36and manage the infection lung volume reduction surgery
4:44is used in severe cases typically in COPD
4:47this is where a non functioning part of the lung is removed
4:52so for example this non-functioning pot
4:55of the Opera Mobile removing this non-functioning party the loan
4:59will allow the other parts of the Longs to function better
5:03despite being also damaged
5:11lung transplantation can and may be performed
5:14in end stage COPD when lungs are damaged
5:18full stop and the person is failing at other treatments
5:21donor lungs are given however
5:25survival benefits has not been demonstrated emphysema
5:28finally there is rehabilitation programs
5:34aim to educate people essentially about emphysema
5:38as well as improving lung function through
5:41certain breathing exercises rehabilitation programs
5:46also provide emotional support amongst many other things
5:49I hope you enjoy this video on the treatments have been the same
5:53thank you for watching
