0:00Let's say we have a path in the xy plane.
0:04That's my y-axis, that is my x-axis, in my path
0:09will look like this.
0:11Let's say it looks like that; trying to draw a bit of an
0:16arbitrary path, and let's say we go in a counter clockwise
0:19direction like that along our path.
0:23And we could call this path-- so we're going in a counter
0:26clockwise direction --we could call that path c.
0:29And let's say we also have a vector field.
0:31And our vector field is going to be a little unusual;
0:34I'll call it p.
0:36p of xy.
0:37It only has an i component, or all of its vectors are only
0:40multiples of the i-unit vector.
0:43So it's capital P of xy times the unit vector i.
0:48There is no j component, so if you have to visualize this
0:51vector field, all of the vectors, they're all multiples
0:57of the i-unit vector.
0:59Or they could be negative multiples, so they could
1:02also go in that direction.
1:03But they don't go diagonal or they don't go up.
1:06They all go left to right or right to left.
1:09That's what this vector field would look like.
1:12Now what I'm interested in doing is figuring out the line
1:15integral over a closed loop-- the closed loop c, or the
1:20closed path c --of p dot dr, which is just our standard
1:27kind of way of solving for a line integral.
1:29And we've seen what dr is in the past.
1:32dr is equal to dx times i plus dy times the j-unit vector.
1:40And you might say, isn't it dx, dt times dt?
1:45Let me write that: can't dr be written as dx, dt times
1:51dti plus dy, dt times dtj?
1:56And it could, but if you imagine these differentials
1:59could cancel out, and you're just left with the dx and
2:01a dy, and we've seen that multiple times.
2:03And I'm going to leave it in this form because hopefully, if
2:06we're careful, we won't have to deal with the third
2:09parameter, t.
2:10So let's just look at it in this form right here with
2:13just the dx's and the dy's.
2:16So this integral can be rewritten as the line integral,
2:21the curve c-- actually let me do it over down here.
2:25The line integral over the path of the curve c of p dot dr. So
2:32we take the product of each of the coefficients, let's say the
2:35coefficient of the i component, so we get p-- I'll do that in
2:39green, actually do that purple color --so we get p of xy times
2:47dx plus-- well there's no 0 times j times dy; 0 times dy id
2:54just going to be 0 --so this our line integral simplified
2:58to this right here.
2:59This is equal to this original integral up here, so we're
3:02literally just taking the line integral around this path.
3:06Now I said that we play our cards right, we're not going to
3:09have to deal with the third variable, t; that we might be
3:12able just solve this integral only in terms of x.
3:15And so let's see if we can do that.
3:16So let's look at our minimum and maximum x points.
3:19That looks like our minimum x point.
3:22Let's call that a.
3:24Let's call that our maximum x point; let's call that b.
3:29What we could do is we can break up this curve into
3:33two functions of x. y is functions of x.
3:36So this bottom one right here we could call as y1 of x.
3:40This is just a standard curve; you know when we were just
3:44dealing with standard calculus, this is just you can
3:47imagine this is f of x and it's a function of x.
3:50And this is y2 of x.
3:51
3:55Just like that.
3:56So you can imagine two paths; one path defined by y1 of x--
4:01let me do that in a different color; magenta --one path
4:04defined by y1 of x as we go from x is equal to a to x is
4:09equal to b, and then another path defined by y2 of x as we
4:14go from x is equal to b to x is equal to a.
4:19That is our curve.
4:21So what we could do is, we could rewrite this integral--
4:24which is the same thing as that integral --as this is equal to
4:29the integral-- we'll first do this first path --of x going
4:33from a to b of p of x.
4:40And I could to say p of x and y, but we know along this
4:43path y is a function of x.
4:47So we say x and y1 of x.
4:51Wherever we see a y we substitute it with
4:53a y1 of x, dx.
4:56So that covers that first path; I'll do it in the same color.
5:02We could imagine this is c1.
5:04This is kind of the first half of our curve-- well it's not
5:07exactly the half --but that takes us right from that
5:09point to that point.
5:10And then we want to complete the circle.
5:13Maybe I'll do that, and I'll do that in yellow.
5:16That's going to be equal to-- sorry we're going to have to
5:19add these two --plus the integral from x is equal to b
5:25to x is equal to a of-- do it in that same color --of p of x.
5:37And now y is going to be y2 of x.
5:40Wherever you see a y, you can substitute with y2
5:42of x along this curve.
5:44y2 of x, dx.
5:49This is already getting interesting and you
5:51might already see where I'm going with this.
5:53So this is the curve c2.
5:56too I think you appreciate if you take the union of c1 and
6:00c2, we've got our whole curve.
6:02So let's see if we can simplify this integral a little bit.
6:05Well one thing we want to do, we might want to make
6:07their end points the same.
6:09So if you swap a and b here, it just turns
6:12the integral negative.
6:13So you make this into a b, that into an a, and then make that
6:17plus sign into a minus sign.
6:20And now we can rewrite this whole thing as being equal to
6:24the integral from a to b of this thing, of p of x and y1 of
6:33x minus this thing, minus p of x and y2 of x, and then
6:44all of that times dx.
6:46I'll write it in a third color.
6:48
6:51Now, I'm going to do something a little bit arbitrary, but I
6:53think you'll appreciate why I did this by the end of this
6:56video, and it's just a very simple operation.
6:58What I'm going to do is I'm going to swap these two.
6:59So I'm essentially going to multiply this whole thing by
7:02negative 1, or essentially multiply and divide
7:05by negative 1.
7:05So I can multiply this by negative 1 and then multiply
7:08the outside by negative 1, and I will not have changed the
7:10integral; I'm multiplying by negative 1 twice.
7:13So if I swap these two things, if I multiply the inside times
7:16negative 1, so this is going to be equal to-- do the outside
7:20of the integral, a to b.
7:22If I multiply the inside-- I'll do a dx out here --if I
7:26multiply the inside of the integral by negative 1,
7:28these two guys switch.
7:30So it becomes p of x of y2 of x.
7:36And then you're going to have minus p of x and y1 of x.
7:46My handwriting's getting a little messy.
7:47But I can't just multiply just the inside by minus 1.
7:51I don't want to change the integral, so I multiplied the
7:53inside by minus 1, let me multiply the outside
7:55by minus 1.
7:56And since I multiplied by minus 1 twice, these two
7:59things are equivalent.
8:00Or you could say this is the negative of that.
8:04Either way, I think you appreciate that I haven't
8:06changed the integral at all, numerically.
8:08I multiplied the inside and the outside by minus 1.
8:11And now the next step I'm going to do, it might look a little
8:15bit foreign to you, but I think you'll appreciate it.
8:17
8:20It might be obvious to you if you've recently done
8:23some double integrals.
8:24So this thing can be rewritten as minus the integral from a to
8:30b of-- and let me do a new color --of the function p of x,
8:38y evaluated at y2 of x minus-- and let me make it very clear;
8:49this is y is equal to y2 of x --minus this function evaluated
8:54at y is equal to y1 of x.
8:59And of course all of that times dx.
9:03This statement and what we saw right here-- this
9:08statement right here --are completely identical.
9:14And then if we assume that a partial derivative of capital P
9:20with respect to y exists, hopefully you'll realize-- and
9:24I'll focus on this a little bit because I don't want to
9:26confuse you on this step.
9:27Let me write the outside of this integral.
9:28So this is going to be equal to-- and this is kind of a neat
9:32outcome, and we're starting to build up to a very neat
9:35outcome, which will probably have to take the next video to
9:38do --so we do the outside dx.
9:41
9:43If we assume that capital P has a partial derivative, this
9:48right here is the exact same thing.
9:51This right here is the exact same thing as the partial
9:54derivative of P with respect to y, dy, the antiderivative of
10:01that from y1 of x to y2 of x.
10:10I want to make you feel comfortable that these two
10:13things are equivalent.
10:14And to realize they're equivalent, you'll probably
10:16just have to start here and then go to that.
10:19We're used to seeing this; we're used to seeing a double
10:21integral like this, and then the very first step we say, OK
10:25to solve this double integral we start on the inside integral
10:29right there, and we say, OK let's take the antiderivative
10:33of this with respect to y.
10:34So if you take the antiderivative of the partial
10:37of p with respect to y, you're going to end up with p.
10:41And since this is a definite integral, the boundaries are
10:44going to be in terms of x, you're going to evaluate that
10:47from y is equal to y2 of x, and you're going to subtract from
10:51that y is equal to y1 of x.
10:53Normally we start with something like this, and we
10:55go to something like this.
10:56This is kind of unusual that we started, we kind of solved, we
10:59started with the solution of the definite integral, and then
11:02we slowly built back to the definite integral.
11:05So hopefully you realize that this is true, that this is
11:08just we're kind of going in a reverse direction
11:10than we normally do.
11:11And if you do realize that, then we've just established
11:13a pretty neat outcome.
11:14Because what is this right here?
11:18Let me go back, let me see if I can fit everything.
11:21I have some function-- and I'm assuming that the partial of
11:25P with respect to y exists --but I have some function
11:29defined over the xy plane.
11:31You know, you could imagine we're dealing in
11:33three dimensions now.
11:35We'll draw a little bit neater.
11:37So that's y, that's x, that's z, so this, you could imagine,
11:46is some surface; it just happens to be the partial
11:48of P with respect to x.
11:50So it's some surface on the xy plane like that.
11:55And what are we doing?
11:57We're taking the double integral under that surface,
12:01around this region.
12:02The region's boundaries in terms of y are defined
12:04by y2 and y1 of x.
12:06
12:08So you literally have that curve.
12:11That's y2 on top, y1 on the bottom.
12:16And so we're essentially taking the volume above.
12:18
12:22So if you imagine with the base is-- the whole floor of this is
12:27going to be the area inside of this curve, and then the height
12:32is going to be the function partial of P with respect to y.
12:36
12:40It's going to be a little hard for me to draw, but this is
12:42essentially some type of a volume, if you want to
12:44visualize it that way.
12:45But the really neat outcome here is if you call this region
12:52r, we've just simplified this line integral.
12:56And this was a special one.
12:57It only had an x-component, the vector field, but we've just
13:01simplified this line integral to being equivalent to-- maybe
13:06I should write this line integral because that's what's
13:09the really neat outcome.
13:10We've just established that this thing right here, which
13:13is the same as our original one, so let me write that.
13:16The closed line integral around the curve c of p of xy, dx,
13:22we've just established that that's the same thing as the
13:25double integral over the region r-- this is the region
13:31r --of the partial of P with respect to y.
13:40
13:47And we could write dy, dx, or we could write da, whatever you
13:52want to write, but this is the double integral
13:53over that region.
13:55The neat thing here is using a vector field that only had an
13:59x-component, we were able to connect its line integral to
14:02the double integral over region-- oh, and I forgot
14:04something very important.
14:06We had a negative sign out here.
14:07So this was a minus sign out here.
14:10Or we could even put the minus in here, but I think you
14:12get the general idea.
14:13In the next video, I'm going to do the same exact thing with
14:16the vector field that only has vectors in the y-direction.
14:20And then we'll connect the two and we'll end up
14:22with Green's theorem.
14:23
