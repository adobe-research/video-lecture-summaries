<p>Good Day, and welcome to the Tecmath channel. In this video what we're going to be having a look at is a way of adding two fractions together, uh, and then... Or subtracting two fractions from each other where we have different, uh, denominators, different bottom numbers. So I'll show you how to do this. It's a really, really simple method, and this is the one I usually show my students at school. It saves a lot of hassle. </p><figure>

That's the easiest way of doing these. OK? Uh, so there you are, put another one up. Hopefully you got that one. All right, I'll, I'll get another fraction. </p><figure>

You get that? All right. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll write a few more examples, because we're going to do a few subtraction ones in a minute.

<p>Uh, let's have a look. We'll see if we can get one. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_001534_001636.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >So, what what about if I had one half to three quarters?

You might've paused it, and given it a go. Hopefully you did. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_001730_001791.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >So what we do is we go 2 times 4 are 8, start at the left. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's really important you start at the left by the way. I'm not starting over here. I'm always starting over here you'll notice. 1 times 4 is 4. We use the plus. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_001850_001911.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >3 times 2 is 6. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_001943_001983.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >OK? So 4 plus 6 is 10, and then we get 10/8. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what you're going to notice first off is that we can simplify this further. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_002028_002046.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >So, let's do this. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_002082_002176.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >First off we look for a number that goes into both of the top and the bottom, and you'll see right away that, that number is 2. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So we divide the top by 2, we get 5. We divide the bottom by 2 we get 4. We can still simplify this. This is at the moment what we call an improper fraction. We can turn this into a proper... Into a mixed number that is. And the way we do this is. And the way we do this is we go 5/4 because if this big... This top number is bigger than the bottom number, you can do this. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002264_002384_group_002264_002384.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures/obj_001534_002384_group.png'" >5/4 is 1, and 1 left over, we put that 1 over the bottom number, which is 4. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I reckon another one. OK. Hopefully these are not a problem, and hopefully you're picking them up really, really easy. I must say I've always wondered why they teach fractions really difficult. I often get a lot of students come in, and they've done fractions three or four times in dif... in their school career, and they still don't get it, and that's actually a little bit annoying. I... oh. Yeah. So, anyway. I'll shut up, and I'll keep going. </p><figure>

I'm starting with mixed numbers, OK. And we're going to be adding mixed numbers. Mixed numbers are where we have a whole number and a fraction together. So, the way we deal with this is we have to turn this into what is known as improper fractions. Is, is a fraction where the b- the number on the top is bigger than the number on the bottom. And the simplest way to do that is you get this number, you times it by this number, and you add to this number. That will give you the number at the top. </p><figure>
