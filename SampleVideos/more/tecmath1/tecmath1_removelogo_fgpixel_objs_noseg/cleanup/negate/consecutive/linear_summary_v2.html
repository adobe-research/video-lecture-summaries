<p>Good Day, and welcome to the Tecmath channel. In this video what we're going to be having a look at is a way of adding two fractions together, uh, and then... Or subtracting two fractions from each other where we have different, uh, denominators, different bottom numbers. So I'll show you how to do this. It's a really, really simple method, and this is the one I usually show my students at school. It saves a lot of hassle. </p><figure>

We can still simplify this. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_002333_002406_group_002199_002240.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001551_002406_group.png'" >This is at the moment what we call an improper fraction. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;We can turn this into a proper... Into a mixed number that is. And the way we do this is. And the way we do this is we go 5/4 because if this big... <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_002333_002406_group_002248_002327.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001551_002406_group.png'" >This top number is bigger than the bottom number, you can do this. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_002333_002406_group_002333_002406.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig2').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001551_002406_group.png'" >5/4 is 1, and 1 left over, we put that 1 over the bottom number, which is 4. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;I reckon another one. OK. Hopefully these are not a problem, and hopefully you're picking them up really, really easy. I must say I've always wondered why they teach fractions really difficult. I often get a lot of students come in, and they've done fractions three or four times in dif... in their school career, and they still don't get it, and that's actually a little bit annoying. I... oh. Yeah. So, anyway. </p><figure>

<p>And the simplest way to do that is you get this number, you times it by this number, and you add to this number. That will give you the number at the top.
