<tr><td>1.  Good Day, and welcome to the Tecmath channel. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>2.  In this video what we're going to be having a look at is a way of adding two fractions together, uh, and then... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  Or subtracting two fractions from each other where we have different, uh, denominators, different bottom numbers. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  So I'll show you how to do this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  It's a really, really simple method, and this is the one I usually show my students at school. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  It saves a lot of hassle. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  So, so for instance we have a fraction like this, 1/2 and we want to add to that 1/3, to do this really, really simply, this is what we do. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000313_000323_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  OK. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  So hit equals, and I'll put that line there. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000330_000353_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  And what we do is this, to get the bottom number first off, what we do is we multiply these numbers. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000373_000490_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  So 2 times 3 is 6. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000492_000515_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  Pretty easy, yeah? And then what we do is we start at the top left here, and we multiply this number by the diagonal here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000540_000604_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  OK? So the diagonal bottom number here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  So one times three is three. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  We use the same sign which is a plus. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000635_000694_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  Then we go to the right number here at the top, and we multiply this number by this number. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000714_000741_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  One times two is two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000744_000760_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  OK, equals. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000765_000779_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  Three plus two is five, and we've got the bottom number of six. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000789_000822_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  And there you go, we've got five six. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  That's the easiest way of doing these. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  OK? Uh, so there you are, put another one up. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  Hopefully you got that one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  All right, I'll, I'll get another fraction. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  What about we have something a bit different? We go one quarter, and I'll put... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  what about something like two thirds? And that equals, all right, let's have a look. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000961_001058_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  Oh, get this pin here and, again, we're work out the bottom number. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001110_001119_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  We multiply these, 4 times 3 is 12. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  We get this number here, the top left, and we multiply it by this number, which is a three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001121_001227_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  Use the same sign, multiply this number by this one. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001249_001313_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  OK? Two by four is eight. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  8 plus 3 is 11 over 12. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001328_001369_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  Yeah? You get that? All right. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001375_001385_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  I'll write a few more examples, because we're going to do a few subtraction ones in a minute. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  Also, you'll notice with a few of these, uh, they're, they're, they're most simple. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  Um, so a couple of these you can simplify a bit further. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  Uh, let's have a look. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  We'll see if we can get one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  So, what what about if I had one half to three quarters? Hopefully this will work. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001534_001636_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  And what we do is, again... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  You might give this one a go before I start. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001658_001671_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  Yeah? You might've paused it, and given it a go. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  Hopefully you did. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  So what we do is we go 2 times 4 are 8, start at the left. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001730_001791_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  It's really important you start at the left by the way. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  I'm not starting over here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  I'm always starting over here you'll notice. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  1 times 4 is 4. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  We use the plus. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  3 times 2 is 6. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001850_001911_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  OK? So 4 plus 6 is 10, and then we get 10/8. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001943_001983_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  Now what you're going to notice first off is that we can simplify this further. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>53.  So, let's do this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002028_002046_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>54.  First off we look for a number that goes into both of the top and the bottom, and you'll see right away that, that number is 2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002082_002176_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>55.  So we divide the top by 2, we get 5. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>56.  We divide the bottom by 2 we get 4. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>57.  We can still simplify this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>58.  This is at the moment what we call an improper fraction. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>59.  We can turn this into a proper... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>60.  Into a mixed number that is. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>61.  And the way we do this is. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>62.  And the way we do this is we go 5/4 because if this big... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>63.  This top number is bigger than the bottom number, you can do this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>64.  5/4 is 1, and 1 left over, we put that 1 over the bottom number, which is 4. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002264_002384_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>65.  I reckon another one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>66.  OK. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>67.  Hopefully these are not a problem, and hopefully you're picking them up really, really easy. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>68.  I must say I've always wondered why they teach fractions really difficult. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>69.  I often get a lot of students come in, and they've done fractions three or four times in dif... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>70.  in their school career, and they still don't get it, and that's actually a little bit annoying. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>71.  I... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>72.  oh. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>73.  Yeah. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>74.  So, anyway. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>75.  I'll shut up, and I'll keep going. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>76.  So what about we do 3/4 and we... </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002682_002734_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>77.  Ugh, multiply. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>78.  We're not going to multiply. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>79.  We're going to add that to 1/3. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002753_002779_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>80.  All right, what does that equal? You get the bottom number 3 times 4, 12. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002783_002873_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>81.  Start up here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>82.  Three 4s are 9. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002876_002897_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>83.  We go plus 1 times 4 is 4. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002902_002912_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>84.  We end up with 13. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>85.  3 plus 4 is...9 </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>86.  plus 4 is 13 over 12. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>87.  That we can simplify further because we have a... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>88.  this number here is bigger than this number, so we divide 12 into 13. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002915_003118_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>89.  12 goes into 13 once, one remainder. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>90.  1/12. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>91.  OK. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>92.  What about if we start with... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>93.  We could do the subtraction one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>94.  OK, what about that? We do 3/4 takeaway, uh, what a 1/3. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003226_003277_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>95.  OK? It's the same sort of thing. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003281_003320_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>96.  This is where it becomes really important that you start in a second. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>97.  Uh, in this top left in a little bit. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003347_003356_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>98.  So, first off we've got four 3s are 12. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>99.  And this is where this bit becomes important. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>100.  You start over here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>101.  Nine 3s. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>102.  No, three 3s are nine. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>103.  You use the minus. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>104.  One 4 is 4. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>105.  9 take 4 is 5. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>106.  This goes out of 12. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003385_003527_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>107.  We have our answer. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>108.  Now, just one little variation on this, by the way. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>109.  Um, I think this is a good thing to get. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>110.  But I might even, um, I won't be able to do this straight away, but I'll put a link up to this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>111.  And this where, uh, we're looking at how to we... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>112.  A question looks like this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>113.  Um, say we have something like 1 and 1/2 and we add that to 2 and 1/3, OK. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003711_003787_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>114.  You're going to notice now I'm not starting with simple fractions. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>115.  I'm starting with mixed numbers, OK. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>116.  And we're going to be adding mixed numbers. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>117.  Mixed numbers are where we have a whole number and a fraction together. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>118.  So, the way we deal with this is we have to turn this into what is known as improper fractions. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>119.  Is, is a fraction where the b- the number on the top is bigger than the number on the bottom. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>120.  And the simplest way to do that is you get this number, you times it by this number, and you add to this number. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>121.  That will give you the number at the top. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>122.  Over that again to get the number at the top. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>123.  This times this, plus this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004072_004134_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>124.  So 1 times 2 is 2. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>125.  Plus 1 is 3. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>126.  The bottom number stays the same. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>127.  The plus stays the same. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004136_004198_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>128.  Again same process. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>129.  2 times 3 is 6, plus 1 is 7. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>130.  Then the bottom number stays the same. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004245_004311_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>131.  And then we trade it, uh, what we were before, OK. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>132.  Bottom number. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>133.  What about I use red for this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>134.  Bottom number two 3s, 6. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>135.  OK. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>136.  We do these ones. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>137.  Three 3s, and 9. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>138.  You put the plus there. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>139.  Seven 2s, a 14. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>140.  Then what we do is we add these guys together, 23. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>141.  Then we put that over 6. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>142.  Now, as you'll see again this number, this is the improper fraction. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004351_004684_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>143.  This number is bigger than this number. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>144.  So we go 23/6 coz this line here means divided by. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>145.  23/6 goes three times coz three 6s are 18. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>146.  We have 5 left over. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004704_004745_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>147.  5 we put that over 6. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>148.  I hope that was of some help. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>149.  Anyway, we'll, uh, see you next time. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>150.  </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
