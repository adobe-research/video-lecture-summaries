0:00good I woke the ticket with channel this video we're going to be having a look at
0:03his wife
0:04adding to fractions together a
0:07or subtracting two fractions from each other we have
0:11different to norman is different bottom
0:14numbers so actually had to do this to really really simple method
0:17this is a while usually ship or should school site a lot of hassle
0:21so site for instance we have fraction of this
0:25half we want to add to that a third
0:28to do this really really simply this is what we do
0:33I so equals and that law there
0:38what we do is ease
0:43to get the part number first of what we do
0:46is we bought report this number so 2.3 6
0:51pretty easy that what we do is we start at the top with Leah
0:55we both report this number boy the diagonal
1:00like a so most audible border
1:03112 3 3 week
1:06use the signs on as a which is a plus we go to the right now but you know the top
1:11border poor this number
1:12for the stub what hopes to is to
1:15cut the cooks 3 post whose phone
1:20but the port number six the jack
1:2446 30 these were doing there is a cut
1:27up so you operate other one up hopefully
1:30you got that one or.org look at of
1:34the fraction weird that we are so you be different though one-quarter
1:38and I'll put with Salil or two-thirds
1:41that Eagles Toro
1:45let's have a look ok
1:48speed your and the kid work at the bottom grabber
1:52we bought for these 4.3
1:5512 we get this to be the top would have to be more deployed he
2:01boy this number which is a3
2:05Jesus I'm so on more Paul this number
2:09for this one to 2004
2:12site I plus three delivered
2:1512 you get
2:1940 Oregon a few more examples
2:22who could do a few subtraction once in a bit also
2:25you those with a few these are the they're the most simple
2:29om into a couple that you can simply for a bit further
2:32I'll let's have a look we'll see if we can get one so what would a very broad
2:36one of to three-quarters
2:40hopefully this work and what we do
2:44he's begin the book gives way to go before or stop
2:48to or oppose you wanna go hopefully did
2:52so what we do as we go to force
2:55iight start it lifts really poor you start with both the white but studies
3:01have your more starting
3:02healers was hopes for is for
3:05use a plus three times to
3:09is six like a so
3:12for plus seeks 10
3:16the weekend 10 nights there what you notice first off
3:20is that we could simple for this further are
3:23so let's do this first off we look for da because it to both
3:28the top to the bottom you'll see try why that number is totally devoid
3:32top bottom for we do or the bottom or two
3:36we for we could still see before this is
3:39the by what we call I and improper fraction we could turn into a proper for
3:44it were mixed up with that is and the way we do this we are for the water
3:48before cuz its peak
3:49stop numbers begin at the barber you could do this
3:52for the water before is one want list or if we put that one
3:57over the barbed which is for
4:00aka Oregon another one
4:04i cud hopefully these a
4:08daughter probably picking them up really really easy a possible was want to
4:12bother teacher fractions
4:13really difficult if you are I'll forget the Wall Street coming to the time for
4:18action
4:18304 towards different this kukri let's do like it
4:21and it actually a little bit oil you so
4:25newer or cultural you know so what a bit we do
4:28three-quarters we border
4:32more employed mock or we r at
4:36to a third
4:39or or what they cool
4:42get the bottom three fourths 12
4:45start-up 3/4 adored
4:50Europe loss what force for
4:53we end up with 39th reports for is
4:57La Paz force that I over twelve that we consider for further because we have a
5:02stop here's be at this number there so we devote
5:0512/30/12 closer to 30 wants
5:08waterbird one over twelve
5:13i cud orbit Eve we
5:17stock weeee we could do this attraction
5:21okay what about that we do three-quarters
5:25title why I with third
5:30aka two sides would be this is where it becomes really poor you start
5:34second is taught lifted a little bit so first of their four through 12
5:39but this is where the speed becomes important start over here
5:42going through these 33 said on
5:45use the bonus what forceful
5:48go take forceful of this goes out 12
5:52we have a renter their to swell the movie reaction on this poll Wycombe
5:56of these a good idea promote even Tom
6:00I won't be able to do this struggle I properly Cup to this
6:03and this is where are we looking at had a
6:07week a question looks like these
6:11so we have something one the Hoff
6:14we at to to food
6:17time you notice there about starting with simple fractions
6:21up starting with mixed numbers like I we'll be adding
6:24mixed numbers mixed up with what we have hold up refreshed
6:27together so the way we deal with this is we have to at least it was gonna
6:32improper fractions is is a fraction with be
6:35that over the top is bigger than up from the bottom the
6:38C-plus why to do that shi'ite this number you told
6:42bought this number your to this number that will give you double top
6:45whether to get to get the double-talk this TOPSIS
6:49posses 112 Stu Stu plus one
6:53is 3 the ball to publicize a sign
6:58the pasta is a sin the kids Cyprus's to
7:02up 36 plus one 7
7:07the bottom stars aside that we traded I'll what we were before
7:11the cat for another abilities rate for this
7:15for number two threes 6
7:19aka we do these ones 3 3's
7:22known put the posse
7:257 to lose 40 there but we does
7:29at this course 23 we put that over 60% a
7:34as you seek it this number
7:37this is improper fraction this numbers bigger this number
7:40so your 23 too far to 46 this law debates to 400 boy
7:4523 2446 three talk
7:4836 I'd we have of
7:52for we put that I've seeks hope that was of some help
7:57anyone willa see you next door
