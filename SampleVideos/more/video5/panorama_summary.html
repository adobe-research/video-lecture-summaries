Hi everyone. 
</p><p>
This is lesson number twenty minus two from a tutorial path on probability and in this lesson we study the uniform distribution. 
</p><p>
If we have a random variable X that follow a uniform distribution, X follows the uniform distribution with parameters a and b. 
</p><p>
Here a and b are the lower and the upper limits of the values that the random variable X can take. 
</p><p>
A uniform random variable is equally likely to take any anybody between it's lower limit and it's upper limit. 
</p><p>
To explain that, I'm going to draw this graph. 
</p><p>
Let's say that's X and then that's the PDF X. 
</p><p>
You said that random variable X takes value between a and b. 
</p><p>
Since it's equally likely to take any value between a and b, it has a plot PDF. 
</p><p>
The PDF is flat. 
</p><p>
In other words, it's a constant function. 
</p><p>
We know that the area under the PDF is always equal to one, so that we have valid probability density function. 
</p><p>
That means the area of this rectangle here should be equal to one. 
</p><p>
But we know area is the base times height. 
</p><p>
We can calculate the length of that height that we need so that the area under this curve, the area of the rectangle is equal to one. 
</p><p>
This base of the rectangle has a length of B minus A. 
</p><p>
Therefore, for b minus a times height should give us an area equal to one, which implies that h should be equal to 1 over b minus a. 
</p><p>
The value taken by the PDF after the uniform distribution, from the lower limit a to the upper limit b is 1 over b minus a. 
</p><p>
In other words, that's the PDF. 
</p><p>
The PDF random variable that follows the uniform distribution a to b equal 1 over b minus a, or values of X between a and b. 
</p><p>
Now that we have the PDF, we're going to derive the CDF F effects. 
</p><p>
Let me actually write it. 
</p><p>
The CDF is going to be... 
</p><p>
I'll show you how to get that Zerofxlessthana equalx minus a over b minus a. 
</p><p>
If X is between a and b, it's 1fxgreaterthanb. 
</p><p>
That's the CDF. 
</p><p>
We also show that the expected value is b plus a over 2 or a plus b over 2. 
</p><p>
That's actually the mid point. 
</p><p>
So it says, since the PDF is plot and constant, the expected value is going to be right at the middle of lower, between the lower limits and the upper limit, which is a plus b over 2 or b plus a over 2. 
</p><p>
The variance of the random variable X is going to be equal to b minus a squared over 12. 
</p><p>
Finally, the MGF, the moment generating function of a uniform random variable, is equal to each of the b times t minus each of the a times t over b minus a times t. 
</p><p>
The rest of this lesson is going to be showing you how to get this CDF expected volume variance and momentarily function. 
</p><p>
Let's find the CDF. 
</p><p>
CDF of a random variable X is equal to the probability that random variable X takes a value less than or equal to little x. 
</p><p>
Let me actually draw that picture again so that I can explain things better. 
</p><p>
We have a here, b, uniform distribution takes any value between a and b, equally likely and height or the density function has a value equal 1 over b minus a. 
</p><p>
When the value of X is less than the lower limit a, then the CDF is equal to zero. 
</p><p>
The reason for that is there's no chance that the random variable X can take value less than little x if, little x is less than a. 
</p><p>
That is because X cannot take values less than a. 
</p><p>
That's equal to zero. 
</p><p>
When X is between a and b, then the CDF is the integral from negative infinity to X of the PDF F effects tx, but the PDF cannot take any value less than a. 
</p><p>
Instead of starting from negative infinity, I can set the lower limit of this integral to be a, so that I have integral from a to X of f effects dX, but f effects is 1 over b minus a, for values of X between a and b. 
</p><p>
This is 1 over b minus a du. 
</p><p>
Now, this integral is equal to u over b minus a, lower limit a, upper limit X. 
</p><p>
When you plug in the upper limit and the lower limit you get X over b minus a minus a over b minus a. 
</p><p>
That is equal to X minus a over b minus a. 
</p><p>
That's the CDF for values of X between a and b. 
</p><p>
It turns out that the CDF... 
</p><p>
what's the CDF at? X is equal to b. 
</p><p>
The CDF and X equal b if fX,b, plug in b in this equation, then you have b minus a over b minus a equal 1. 
</p><p>
With that in mind, we can actually just write the CDF when X is greater than b. 
</p><p>
When X is greater than b, the CDF is equal to one. 
</p><p>
F effects is equal to one. 
</p><p>
I could have actually found that CDF in a much easier way than the way I did with integrals. 
</p><p>
If this is the point X, the probability that random variable X takes a value less than or equal to little x, is equal to the area of that rectangle. 
</p><p>
You really didn't need to do the integral. 
</p><p>
If you calculate the area of that rectangle, the base as a value of X minus a times height, which is 1 over b minus a, that gives you X minus a over b minus a. 
</p><p>
Expected value of the random variable X is the integral overall the support of the random variable X. 
</p><p>
Let's say the support for X is script X of X times f effects dx. 
</p><p>
We know actually the support is from a to b, any value from the lower limit to the upper limit. 
</p><p>
X times f effects is 1 over b minus adx. 
</p><p>
1 over b minus a is a constant just like to X, so I can take it outside of the integral and I have integral a to b, not X, dx. 
</p><p>
That's equal to 1 over b minus a minus x squared over 2, lower limit a, the upper limit b. 
</p><p>
Plug in the lower limit and the upper limit here. 
</p><p>
You would find out this is equal to 1 over b minus a times b squared minus a squared over 2. 
</p><p>
b squared minus a squared is the difference of two squares, which I can rewrite as b minus a times b plus a then I have divided by two.So 
</p><p>
b minus a cancels out b minus a therefore I am left with b plus a over 2. 
</p><p>
The variance of the random variable X is the second moment minus the first moment square. 
</p><p>
We know the first moment.First 
</p><p>
moment is b plus a over 2. 
</p><p>
We can just find the second moment and then we use the first moment that we have here to calculate the variance. 
</p><p>
Second moment is the integral from a to b. 
</p><p>
In this case of X squared, f effects dx. 
</p><p>
That is equal to the integral a to b. 
</p><p>
X squared plus 1 over b minus adx. 
</p><p>
Again, 1 over b minus a is a constant with respect to X, so that can be outside of the integral from a to b, x squared dx. 
</p><p>
That is equal to 1 over b minus a times X cubed over 3, evaluated from the lower limit a to the upper limit b. 
</p><p>
This is b minus a times by... 
</p><p>
If you plug in the upper limit and the lower limit, you get b cubed minus a cubed over 3. 
</p><p>
b cubed minus a cubed is the difference of two cubes.The 
</p><p>
difference of two cubes can be written as b minus a... 
</p><p>
revise that from your algebra, if you don't remember. 
</p><p>
b minus a times b squared plus ab plus a squared over 3. 
</p><p>
Here again, b minus a here cancels out b minus a up here. 
</p><p>
Therefore we are left with b squared plus a times b plus a squared over 3. 
</p><p>
That's the second moment. 
</p><p>
To find the variance, I need to subtract the first moment squared from the second moment. 
</p><p>
Second moment is b squared times ab plus ab plus a squared over 3 minus the square of the first moment. 
</p><p>
The first moment is b plus a over 2. 
</p><p>
This is b squared plus a times b plus a squared minus b squared plus 2ab plus a squared over 4. 
</p><p>
This common factor is 12. 
</p><p>
12 over 3 is four, so we have four times b squared plus a times b plus a squared minus 12 over 4 is 3. 
</p><p>
So 3 times b squared plus 2ab plus a squared. 
</p><p>
That is equal to 4b squared plus 4 times ab plus 4a squared minus 3b squared minus 6 times ab minus 3a squared. 
</p><p>
All quantity divided by twelve. 
</p><p>
Again, 4b squared minus 3b squared is b squared. 
</p><p>
4ab minus 6ab is minus 2ab. 
</p><p>
4a squared minus 3a squared plus a squared over 12. 
</p><p>
b squared minus 2ab plus b squared is b minus a squared over 12. 
</p><p>
That's the variance of the random variable X which follows a uniform distribution between the lower limit a and the upper limit b. 
</p><p>
We found the CDF expected value to variance. 
</p><p>
We're going to go ahead and find the moment generating function. 
</p><p>
The MGF MX of t is the expected value of e to the t times X. 
</p><p>
That is equal to the integral over all the support of the random variable X, which is from hb and of e to the t times X times f effects dx, but f effects is one over b minus adx. 
</p><p>
I can again take one over b minus a outside of the integral and multiply it by the integral a to b of e to the t times Xdx. 
</p><p>
That is equal to 1 over b minus a times ato the t times X over t, lower limit a, upper limit b. 
</p><p>
That's equal to one over b minus a times e to the t times b minus e to the t times a over t. 
</p><p>
When you rewrite this, you will find out that the MGF is e to the t times b minus e to the t times a over b minus a times t. 
</p><p>
That's the MGF of a uniform random variable. 
</p><p>
