How do I deal with this? And the key realization is to realize what happens when you switch bounds for a definite integral. And I'll do a little bit of an aside to review that. </p><figure>

This is how we evaluate definite integrals. Now, let's think about what the negative of this is. </p><figure>

Or if you switch the boundaries, they are the negatives of each other. So we can go back to our original problem. </p><figure>
