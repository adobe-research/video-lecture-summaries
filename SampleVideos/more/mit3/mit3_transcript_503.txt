0:00dumb
0:04so here we are looking on aircraft
0:08climbing a consular law student community with a clam
0:12anger of tip and be careful not to confuse the claim bungle with done with
0:17the puck
0:18done little foot doc which we usually call
0:21opera is on good between the free stream direction
0:25under aircraft's longitudinal direction which we usually call
0:29X and here it's quite apparent that
0:33x's a line with us free stream a so the underfoot the keys you
0:37now the climb under
0:40is under between the aircraft's motion
0:43or across the loss tea on the horizontal direction
0:47sole risk to derive an expression for the rate of decline
0:52which is divert cover lost older aircraft
0:55on which bill did Mineral King us H dot h4 altitude
0:59dot to indicate the time do it so say this is your work
1:05its struggling at a loss to the Infinity
1:08at the claim bungled did
1:16Seiko hope you're not confused by
1:18its from a recess change you can either say
1:21that the aircraft is stationary
1:24under the free speech in the loss to have been Fiji coming into their comps
1:28ordered aircraft is moving
1:31with the speed be infinite so the rate of climb
1:36is the projection of the Infiniti the victor
1:39into the horizontal direction H dot
1:42so is she that H dot it simply the Infiniti
1:47times signed it
1:50now we will do is the sum of forces
1:54over the z-direction I know the x-direction
2:00decomposed to wait
2:03into two components long Z and I'll
2:06X a star by writing to the summer forces
2:09along the z-direction is you so a couple lift
2:12in the positive direction that this year and then
2:16W course linked it to
2:21and this one doesn't have to suffer the question but he won't write it down
2:24uncommon to lead
2:27then if your project along the x-direction have
2:31on one side thrust I host to compensate for both
2:36drug on the projection of the wait
2:41onto the x-direction W
2:44sign tip so from this
2:49you can simply write that sin theta is equal to thrust
2:57mine is dried you buy but wait
3:01unplugged is but into a question for
3:05H dot
3:07to write to the the rate of climb H dot
3:10is simply
3:14the Infiniti times to for us
3:19mine is dried Dubai but to wait
3:23which is expression we would look for
3:28note key miners d
3:32is excess
3:35trust and if you multiply that by the Infiniti
3:45the fly to Los T so the Infiniti times
3:48de menos de you good
3:52excess power and that is the first power
3:58that is available for time
4:03no I want to ride the some other forces
4:06into z-direction because they wanted to remember
4:10though when you're climbing lift is
4:13W the wait time school sainted
4:16sodom on of relief that you need for climbing
4:19is actually smaller done deal if you need for a cruise
4:23but still deliver flight by a factor of course I'm to
4:27it's a common misconception that you need more lift climb
4:32that is not true what provides a force or power
4:35for climbing is the frost not
4:39the left you need a positive
4:42excess thrust that is frost
4:47larger to drive in order to climb it's the engine
4:51that doesn't look for climbing
4:56the do
