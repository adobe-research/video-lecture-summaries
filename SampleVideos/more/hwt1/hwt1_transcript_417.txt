0:06hi in this beer
0:07I'm gonna talk about the anatomy of the heart and this is just going to be in
0:13overview
0:13the gross anatomy a hard and the Chamber's
0:17showed
0:21quickly here and I'm gonna grow this so that
0:25it's being dissected to show
0:28all the changes all the heart and all the valves
0:47for small
0:49blood flows through the heart like
0:53into the heart here and from here
0:57and this comes from the body is plugged into
1:02this chain me here and flew them through here
1:06then up through the chain that and up the special
1:10ago that to the lungs here
1:13and income back in
1:17through these bands
1:21here in here
1:25in the blood moves down through these two chambers
1:30and then back up through this girl
1:36and out through this vessel and label these vessels now
1:42and the Chandos and the belts so these two vessels
1:49other vina caber this is a superior
1:54the makeover
2:01this is the inferior being
2:03caper
2:12the blood
2:13the in goes into the right
2:16atrium and that this chamber the heart yeah then
2:20it moves through the TriCaster Bell named truck of that because it has
2:26broadcast into
2:30the brought ventricle but then for
2:38after the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve
2:42into the pulmonary
2:46trunk at this point because
2:51to the lungs then returning from the lungs
2:55inches the next chamber by
2:58the pulmonary bangs
3:03missed
3:04oranges is the left atrium below the left atrium
3:11is the mitral bow
3:14also known as the bike us the bell because it only has
3:182 cups then
3:21it flows into the left ventricle which is the main pumping chamber
3:26%uh ha the blood inflows
3:30out through the or dick dale's and out the aorta
3:34body now just label
3:37some other things here the pulmonary valve is this Dell
3:42here at proximal and pulmonary trunk
3:52is the in
3:53her ventricular septem this is a certain
3:56lies between two ventricles here see apex
4:00and finally here's the high water
4:05missus
