0:06Hi. In this video
0:07I'm gonna talk about the anatomy of the heart, and this is just going to be an
0:13overview
0:13of the gross anatomy of the heart and the chambers.
0:17So I just draw the heart
0:21quickly here and I'm gonna draw this so that
0:25it's been dissected to show
0:28all the chambers of the heart and all the valves.
0:47So, first of all let's have a look at the way
0:49blood flows through the heart. Blood comes
0:53into the heart here and from here
0:57and this comes from the body. This flows into
1:02this chamber here and flows down through here
1:06then up through this chamber then out this vessel.
1:10It goes out to the lungs here,
1:13and then come back in
1:17through these veins
1:21here and here.
1:25Then the blood moves down through these two chambers
1:30and then back up through this valve,
1:36and out through this vessel. I am going to label these vessels now
1:42and the chambers and the valves. So these two vessels
1:49are the vena cava. This is the superior
1:54vena cava.
2:01This is the inferior vena 
2:03cava.
2:12The blood
2:13from there goes into the right
2:16atrium, and that is this chamber of the heart here. Then
2:20it moves through the Tricuspid valve, named tricuspid because it has
2:26three cusps, into
2:30the right ventricle. Blood then flows
2:38out of the right ventricle through the pulmonary valve
2:42into the pulmonary
2:46trunk. At this point because
2:51to the lungs then returning from the lungs
2:55it inches the next chamber by
2:58the pulmonary veins.
3:03And this chambered entrances 
3:04is the left atrium. Below the left atrium
3:11is the mitral valve,
3:14also known as the bicuspid valve because it only has
3:18two cusps. then 
3:21it flows into the left ventricle which is the main pumping chamber
3:26of the heart. The blood then flows
3:30out through the aortic valve and out the aorta to the
3:34body. Now just label
3:37some other things here. The pulmonary valve is this valve
3:42here at proximal end of the pulmonary trunk.
3:52Here is the
3:53inter-ventricular septum. This is a septum that
3:56lies between two ventricles. Here is the apex
4:00and finally here's the aorta.

4:05And this is an overview of the anatomy of the heart.
