<p><b>(a)</b> In the last video we considered some of the assumptions that are made when we consider the bigbang theory and there are two key assumptions. </p><p><b>(b)</b> The first is the cause morjera principle which says that on large enough scales large scales the universe is both homogeneous which means it looks the same at all points and isotropic so there's no special directions in the universe. </p><p>And our second assumption was that all the laws of physics that we have studied and come to understand are valid everywhere in the universe. </p><p>And for the purposes of stating the Big Bang probably the most important law of physics is general relativity. </p><p><b>(c)</b> And general to be is Einstein's theory of gravity but incentive describing gravity as a pulling force eisenstein describes gravity as the effect love matter and energy actually curving space-time. </p><p>And when you have a curved spacetime the curvature of that space time will actually tell matter in energy how to move and how to flow. </p></div>

And in this picture one of the most important things is that space is not just some fixed background that matter and energy move around on. Rather space-time will actually take a dynamical role and involve rate along with matter and energy as the universal so it's going to be very important for us to understand the geometry of the space-time. </div>

<p>So a good place to start from here is saying well if the geometry of space is going to be so important what kinds of geometrys can I have that satisfy the cosmological principle? What kind of geometry is gonna have that are both homogeneous and isotropic? And for the purposes simplicity we're just going to you start by considering some two-dimensional surfaces two dimensional spaces. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And by considering the spaces will learn the general properties that some of these different geometries can have. </div>

<p><b>(a)</b> And the are very now very analogous cases to three dimensional spaces your universe has three dimensions so book the lessons we learned looking at two dimensional spaces all right through to the 3d is to the first tape up space that we can have is probably one that were most comfortable with the idea I love just say on infinite flat planes. </p><p>Let's just say I have some plane that extends in all directions. </p><p>So this is flat. </p><p>Its infinite in size. </p><p><b>(b)</b> And all love the rules have geometry that we've learned in grade school still applies. </p><p><b>(c)</b> So if I draw say a triangle on MySpace then the angles of that triangle will add up to 180 degrees is a rule that we've probably all learning public school and probably familiar to most. </p><p>It still applies in this case. </p><p>And we notice that this space if it's a infinite extent is homogeneous there's no special points on here. </p><p>And its isotropic there's no special directions. </p><p><b>(d)</b> Now this isn't the only kind of space that week. </p><p>For example we could consider the surface of a sphere drugs year. </p><p>And this space will have different geometric properties. </p><p><b>(e)</b> So we would see that this piece is positively curved positively curved. </p><p>And we noticed that this space is actually a finite space there's only so much period so it's fine. </p><p>But even though it's a finite space it still has no way to if I were a two-dimensional person living on this on this two-dimensional surface I could walk around and around and never come into any boundary or anything. </p><p><b>(f)</b> And if I look at my you know general rules and geometry if I make a triangle on this curved surface the triangle might look something like this. </p><p><b>(g)</b> And this triangle where each of these lines are following straight lines on this curved space. </p><p>If I sum up the angle said the strike makes then the angles will actually some up to you more than a hundred me degrees. </p><p>So it's a very different kind of geometry than the flight geometry we're used to. </p><p><b>(h)</b> However this geometry is still homogeneous and isotropic if I'm living on the server on this surface there's no special points and there's no special directions still satisfies the cosmological principle now there's another table space that I can have and that is a negative leakers space in this ones kinda difficult to draw so let's see how I do it this it kinda looks like this she a sample so so we have the Sun or shade and we say this has negative curvature negative the occur this space like the plane would be infinite incise extending these directions 0 as far as you wanna go but when I look at a a triangle on this shape following straight lines on the skirt space the triangle might look something like this and the angles have that triangle would add up to you less than a hundred need degrees. </p></div>

<p><b>(a)</b> So again we have a different type geometry with this geometry is also going to be homogeneous and isotropic so it's still on the ballot possibility for for the shipper for universe. </p><p>Now there are other geometry SEDAR that are out there that could exist for instance I could have. </p><p><b>(b)</b> And service fear I could have some sort of egg shape but we notice when looking at this X shape that the curvature at the at the very top of the egg is going to be different than the curvature on the side of the eggs signs of the eggs are the Aggies much more flattened the very in the very tip. </p></div>

So that means these two points are going to be different and that goes against our are a cosmological principle this space would not be homogeneous anymore either differences between spaces. So even though we could have other geometries these are the only three kinds of geometry that we can have for the universe that are both homogeneous and isotropic. And in order to identify Witcher the shapes actually describes our universe were alternately going to have to go and measure something to you identify which type it is but we'll talk about that sort of a thing later. Now looking at these two curved geometry is you might be saying well these can actually describe what the universe looks like I can you know get to friends and a couple pieces a string in and go out and form a triangle and measure the angles in a triangle in a notice that the land up to 180 degrees like the flat plains. So this must be unambiguously what the shaoe universes is. </div>

<p><b>(a)</b> And my response to that would be if you look this at the surface for instance this fear on very very small spaces on very small scales then this little patch will appear to be almost flat for the same reason that people for hundreds of years thought that the earth was flat. </p><p>If you're only looking on small scales the surface appear seems like. </p><p><b>(b)</b> It's only when you kinda walk-on larger scales that you realize that the year is actually round so for all the surfaces. </p><p><b>(c)</b> If you look on smaller scales will appear flat but with modern technology and modern telescopes were actually able to see far enough to begin to test the kinda large-scale properties the geometry of our universe. </p><p>So if this can a length scale is on the order of billions of light-years then looking on scales like the earth and the solar system you're not going to be able to notice the curvature space on the scales. </p><p>Now when working with these curved spaces there's something that's very very important note and is a source love lot of confusion when it comes to talking about the geometry of the early universe. </p><p><b>(d)</b> And that is the idea of when I draw this picture just for kinda simplicity in in our understanding of this geometry I draw it as the two-dimensional surface love a three-dimensional sphere. </p><p>And the truth is that if I have this two-dimensional space I can completely describe that two-dimensional space using only the properties on that surface without ever having to refer to some third dimension volume this object or or anything else. </p></div>

<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">

It can be completely on its own perfectly valid two-dimensional space. And it is actually fairly easy to describe mathematically. Same with this other curb geometry. I can completely describe that without ever referring to any higher dimensional space. </div>

<p><b>(a)</b> So when we start talking about universe expanding and contracting what we're talking about is I have this so homogeneous I'm isotropic geometry and maybe that geometry start small. </p><p><b>(b)</b> And then that geometry expands into some into some what we would call larger geometry. </p><p><b>(c)</b> There's more surface area here than there is here. </p><p>But what people often want to say is that there is some higher dimensional space that this object that this surface is expanding into. </p><p>But I can describe a love the geometry completely staying on this surface without ever leaving the serface. </p><p>A higher dimension does not have to exist in order for this to be a consistent theory. </p><p><b>(d)</b> And when we talk more about the expansion of the universe this is the kind of expansion were talking about this geometry space itself changing and if I have say two points on the surface then shipping brighter color then if I am cue points on this surface then as this space expands. </p><p><b>(e)</b> Then these two points will appear to be further apart it'll take longer for like to bounce back and forth. </p><p>And this doesn't just happen for curved geometry. </p><p><b>(f)</b> So I can have this plan geometry starting in a a somewhat kinda compressed state you can say so so these two points are close together in takes like certain amount of time to bounce between knows. </p><p><b>(g)</b> But that geometry through general to be because we said that in according to general to be space-time can actually evolving changing based on the matter and energy that's in it. </p><p><b>(h)</b> So this piece can actually expand and these two points will be further will be moved farther away from each other it'll take away a longer amount of time to travel between those two points. </p><p>But one of the important things to know when we're considering these expending geometry is is that we do not need to have some higher dimension that this thing is expanding into. </p><p>We don't have compressed matter and empty space outside this is expanding into. </p><p>We can completely describe this simply as the geometry this space is changing. </p><p>Only talking about only using on these better on that geometry not anywhere anywhere else here. </p><p>So when people sometimes say that the universe is expanding into something that's like saying I have bar that has a certain amount of temperature and that temperature is is increasing and what is that temperature increasing into when we talk about it that way this question what is the universe is expanding into just doesn't make sense anymore. </p><p><b>(i)</b> So so that's very important point that I really want to emphasize their does not have to be some higher dimensional space at this is expanding into. </p></div>
