<p>In the last video, we considered some of the assumptions that are made when we consider the Big Bang theory. There are two key assumptions. The first is the cosmological principle which says that on large enough scales the universe is both homogeneous, which means it looks the same at all points, and isotropic, so there's no special directions in the universe. Our second assumption was that all of the laws of physics that we have studied and come to understand are valid everywhere in the universe. For the purposes of studying the Big Bang, probably the most important law of physics is general relativity. General relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity. But instead of describing gravity as a pulling force, Einstein describes gravity as the effect of matter and energy actually curving spacetime. </p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
<p>When you have a curved spacetime, the curvature of that spacetime will actually tell matter and energy how to move and how to flow. In this picture, one of the most important things is that space is not just some fixed background that matter and energy move around on, rather spacetime will actually take a dynamical role and evolve right along with matter and energy as the universe evolves. It's going to be very important for us to understand the geometry of this spacetime. A good place to start from here is saying, \ if the geometry of space is gonna be so important, what kinds of geometries can I have that satisfy the cosmological principle? </p></div>

<p>What kind of geometries can I have that are both homogeneous and isotropic?\ </p></div>

</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
<p>For the purposes of simplicity, we're just going to start by considering some two-dimensional surfaces, two-dimensional spaces. By considering these spaces, we'll learn the general properties that some of these different geometries can have. They have very analogous cases to three-dimensional spaces. We know our universe has three dimensions. But the lessons we learn looking at two-dimensional spaces will follow right through to the 3D case. </p></div>

<p>The angles of that triangle would add up to less than 180 degrees. Again, we have a different type of geometry. But this geometry is also going to be homogeneous and isotropic. </p></div>

<p>It's still a valid possibility for the shape of our universe. There are other geometries that are out there, that could exist. For instance, instead of a sphere, I could have some sort of egg shape. But we notice, when looking at this egg shape, that the curvature at the very top of the egg is going to be different than the curvature on the side of the egg. </p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
<p>The side of the egg is much more flat than the very tip of it. That means these two points are going to be different. That goes against our cosmological principle. This space would not be homogeneous anymore. There are differences between those spaces. Even though we could have other geometries, these are the only three kinds of geometries that we can have for the universe that are both homogeneous and isotropic. In order to identify which of these shapes actually describes our universe, we're ultimately going to have to go and measure something to identify which type it is. But we'll talk about that sort of thing later. Now, looking at these two curved geometries, you might be saying, \ these can't actually describe what the universe looks like. I can, you know, get two friends and a couple of pieces of string and, and go out and form a triangle, and measure the angles in that triangle. And I notice that they'll add up to 180 degrees, like the flat plane. So, so this must be unambiguously what the shape of our universe is.\ </p></div>

<img src="../../../../../../../Mainpage/figures/arrow_collapsed_icon.png" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow2_sub1"                                     onclick="showline2_sub1()">

<div id="line2_sub1_c2" class="c2", width="">
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>My response to that would be, \ you look at this, um, at this surface of, for instance, this sphere on very, very small spaces, on very small scales, then this little patch will appear to be almost flat for the same reason that people for hundreds of years thought that the Earth was flat.\ If you're only looking on small scales, the surface of the Earth seems flat. It's only when you kind of look on larger scales that you realize that the Earth is actually round. For all of these surfaces, if you look on small enough scales, it will appear flat. But with modern technology and modern telescopes, we're actually able to see far enough to begin to test the kind of large-scale properties of the geometry of our universe. If this kind of length scale is on the order of billions of light years, then looking on scales like the Earth and the solar system, you're not going to be able to notice the curvature of space on those scales. When working with these curved spaces, there's something that's very, very important to note and is a source of a lot of confusion when it comes to talking about the geometry of the early universe. That is the idea of, when I draw this picture just for kind of simplicity and, and our understanding of this geometry, I draw it as the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional sphere. </p></div>
</div>

<div id="c0" class="", width="">
<p>The truth is that if I have this two-dimensional space, I can completely describe that two-dimensional space using only the properties on that surface without ever having to refer to some third dimension, the volume of this object, or anything else. It can be completely on its own a perfectly valid two-dimensional space. It's actually fairly easy to describe mathematically. Same with this other curved geometry. I can completely describe that without ever referring to any higher dimensional space. </p></div>

<p>There does not have to be some higher dimensional space that this is expanding into. We'll talk a little bit more about how the universe expands and what sort of effects the expansion of the universe has in future videos. </p></div>
