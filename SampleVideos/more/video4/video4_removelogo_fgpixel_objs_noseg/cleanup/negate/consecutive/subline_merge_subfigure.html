<h1>The Big Bang: The Shape of the Universe </h1><br>
<h3>The following is a summary of a lecture video. You may click on the '+' buttons next to the figures in order to expand further details.</h3><div id="c1c2wrapper" class="", width="">

<div class="plus" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow0_sub0"                                     onclick="showline0_sub0()"> + </div>

<p>
In the last video, we considered some of the assumptions that are made when we consider the Big Bang theory. 
</p><p>
There are two key assumptions. 
</p><p>
The first is the cosmological principle which says that on large enough scales the universe is both homogeneous, which means it looks the same at all points, and isotropic, so there's no special directions in the universe. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line0_upto_sub0_stc2.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
Our second assumption was that all of the laws of physics that we have studied and come to understand are valid everywhere in the universe. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
For the purposes of studying the Big Bang, probably the most important law of physics is general relativity. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
General relativity is Einstein's theory of gravity. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
But instead of describing gravity as a pulling force, Einstein describes gravity as the effect of matter and energy actually curving spacetime. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line0_upto_sub0_stc6.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
When you have a curved spacetime, the curvature of that spacetime will actually tell matter and energy how to move and how to flow. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In this picture, one of the most important things is that space is not just some fixed background that matter and energy move around on, rather spacetime will actually take a dynamical role and evolve right along with matter and energy as the universe evolves. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's going to be very important for us to understand the geometry of this spacetime. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
A good place to start from here is saying, \ if the geometry of space is gonna be so important, what kinds of geometries can I have that satisfy the cosmological principle? </div>
<div id="c1c2wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="line1_sub0_c1" class="", width="">
<div class="plus" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow1_sub0"                                     onclick="showline1_sub0()"> + </div>
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line1_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="line1_sub0_c2" class="c2", width="">
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
What kind of geometries can I have that are both homogeneous and isotropic?\ 
</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
For the purposes of simplicity, we're just going to start by considering some two-dimensional surfaces, two-dimensional spaces. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
By considering these spaces, we'll learn the general properties that some of these different geometries can have. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
They have very analogous cases to three-dimensional spaces. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We know our universe has three dimensions. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
But the lessons we learn looking at two-dimensional spaces will follow right through to the 3D case. </div>
<div id="c1c2wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="line2_sub0_c1" class="", width="">
<div class="plus" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow2_sub0"                                     onclick="showline2_sub0()"> + </div>
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="line2_sub0_c2" class="c2", width="">
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
The first type of space that we can have is probably one that we're most comfortable with the idea of just, say, an infinite flat plane. 
</p><p>
Let's just say I have some plane that extends in all directions. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc18.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
This is flat. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It's infinite in size. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
All of the rules of geometry that we've learned in grade school still apply. 
</p><p>
If I draw, say, a triangle on this space, then the angles of that triangle will add up to 180 degrees. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc22.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
This is a rule that we've probably all learned in public school and, hopefully, familiar to most. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It still applies in this case. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
We notice that this space, if it's infinite in extent, is homogeneous, there's no special points on here and it's isotropic there's no special directions. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
This isn't the only kind of space that we could have. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc26.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
For example, we could consider the surface of a sphere, so let's draw a sphere. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
This space will have different geometric properties. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
We would say that this space is positively curved. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc29.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
We notice that this space is actually a finite space. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
There's only so much area it has, so it's finite. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
But, even though it's a finite space, it still has no edge to it. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
If I were a two-dimensional person living on this two-dimensional surface, I could walk around and around and never come into any boundary or anything. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
If I look at my general rules of geometry, if I make a triangle on this curved surface, the triangle might look something like this. 
</p><p>
This triangle where each of these lines are following straight lines on this curved space, if I sum up the angles that this triangle makes, then the angles will actually sum up to more than 180 degrees. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc35.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It's a very different kind of geometry than the flat geometry we're used to. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
However, this geometry is still homogeneous and isotropic. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
If I'm living on this surface, there's no special points, and there's no special direction. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It still satisfies the cosmological principle. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
There's another type of space that I can have. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc40.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
That is a negatively curved space. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
This one is kind of difficult to draw, so let's see how I do with this. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It kind of looks like this shape of a saddle. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
We have this saddle shape, and we say this has negative curvature, negatively curved. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc44.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
This space, like the plane, would be infinite in size. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
It would extend in these directions out as far as you want to go. 
</p><p>
But when I look at a triangle on this shape, following straight lines on this curved space, the triangle might look something like this. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub0_stc47.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The angles of that triangle would add up to less than 180 degrees. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Again, we have a different type of geometry. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
But this geometry is also going to be homogeneous and isotropic. </div>
<div id="c1c2wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="line3_sub0_c1" class="", width="">
<div class="plus" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow3_sub0"                                     onclick="showline3_sub0()"> + </div>
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line3_sub0.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="line3_sub0_c2" class="c2", width="">
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
It's still a valid possibility for the shape of our universe. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line3_upto_sub0_stc51.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
There are other geometries that are out there, that could exist. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
For instance, instead of a sphere, I could have some sort of egg shape. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
But we notice, when looking at this egg shape, that the curvature at the very top of the egg is going to be different than the curvature on the side of the egg. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line3_upto_sub0_stc54.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The side of the egg is much more flat than the very tip of it. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That means these two points are going to be different. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That goes against our cosmological principle. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This space would not be homogeneous anymore. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
There are differences between those spaces. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Even though we could have other geometries, these are the only three kinds of geometries that we can have for the universe that are both homogeneous and isotropic. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In order to identify which of these shapes actually describes our universe, we're ultimately going to have to go and measure something to identify which type it is. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
But we'll talk about that sort of thing later. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, looking at these two curved geometries, you might be saying, \ these can't actually describe what the universe looks like. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
I can, you know, get two friends and a couple of pieces of string and, and go out and form a triangle, and measure the angles in that triangle. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And I notice that they'll add up to 180 degrees, like the flat plane. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So, so this must be unambiguously what the shape of our universe is.\ </div>
<div id="c1c2wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="line2_sub1_c1" class="", width="">
<div class="plus" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow2_sub1"                                     onclick="showline2_sub1()"> + </div>
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="line2_sub1_c2" class="c2", width="">
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
My response to that would be, \ you look at this, um, at this surface of, for instance, this sphere on very, very small spaces, on very small scales, then this little patch will appear to be almost flat for the same reason that people for hundreds of years thought that the Earth was flat.\ 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub1_stc67.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
If you're only looking on small scales, the surface of the Earth seems flat. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
It's only when you kind of look on larger scales that you realize that the Earth is actually round. 
</p><p>
For all of these surfaces, if you look on small enough scales, it will appear flat. 
</p><p>
But with modern technology and modern telescopes, we're actually able to see far enough to begin to test the kind of large-scale properties of the geometry of our universe. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub1_stc71.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
If this kind of length scale is on the order of billions of light years, then looking on scales like the Earth and the solar system, you're not going to be able to notice the curvature of space on those scales. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
When working with these curved spaces, there's something that's very, very important to note and is a source of a lot of confusion when it comes to talking about the geometry of the early universe. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
That is the idea of, \ I draw this picture just for kind of simplicity and, and our understanding of this geometry, I draw it as the two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional sphere.\ 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line2_upto_sub1_stc74.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The truth is that if I have this two-dimensional space, I can completely describe that two-dimensional space using only the properties on that surface without ever having to refer to some third dimension, the volume of this object, or anything else. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It can be completely on its own a perfectly valid two-dimensional space. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's actually fairly easy to describe mathematically. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Same with this other curved geometry. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
I can completely describe that without ever referring to any higher dimensional space. </div>
<div id="c1c2wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="line4_sub0_c1" class="", width="">
<div class="plus" border="1px" height="20px" id="arrow4_sub0"                                     onclick="showline4_sub0()"> + </div>

<div id="line4_sub0_c2" class="c2", width="">
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
When we start talking about the universe expanding and contracting, what we're talking about is, \ have this homogeneous and isotropic geometry, and maybe that geometry starts small. 
</p><p>
And then that geometry expands into some, into some what we would call a larger geometry.\ 
</p><p>
There's more surface area here than there is here. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line4_upto_sub0_stc82.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
But what people often want to say is that there is some higher dimensional space that this object, that this surface is expanding into. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
But I can describe all of the geometry completely staying on this surface, without ever leaving this surface. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
A higher dimension does not have to exist in order for this to be a consistent theory. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
When we talk more about the expansion of the universe, this is the kind of expansion that we're talking about, this geometry of space itself changing. 
</p><p>
If I have, say, two points on this surface, here, let's see if I can get a bit brighter color then, as this space expands, these two points will appear to be farther apart. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line4_upto_sub0_stc87.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It will take longer for light to bounce back and forth. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
This doesn't just happen for curved geometries. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
I can have this flat geometry starting in a somewhat kind of compressed state, you can say. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line4_upto_sub0_stc90.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
These two points start close together. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
Then it takes light a certain amount of time to bounce between those. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
But that geometry, through general relativity, because we said that according to general relativity spacetime can actually evolve and change based on the matter and energy that's in it this space can actually expand. 
</p><p>
These two points will be moved farther away from each other. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_2" class="", width="">
<img src= "subline_merge_subfigure/line4_upto_sub0_stc94.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
It will take light a longer amount of time to travel between those two points. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
But one of the important things to note when we're considering these expanding geometries is that we do not need to have some higher dimension that this thing is expanding into. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
We don't have compressed matter and empty space outside that this is expanding into. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
We can completely describe this simply as, \ geometry of this space is changing\ only using quantities that are on that geometry, not anywhere else out here. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
When people sometimes say that the universe is expanding into something, that's like saying, \ have a, a burrow that has a certain amount of temperature, and that temperature is, is increasing. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
And what is that temperature increasing into?\ 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
When we talk about it that way, this question of, \ is the universe expanding into?\ 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_3" class="", width="">
<p>
just doesn't make sense anymore. 
</p></div>
<div id="c2_12wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c2_1" class="", width="">
<p>
That's a very important point that I really want to emphasize.

There does not have to be some higher dimensional space that this is expanding into. </div>
