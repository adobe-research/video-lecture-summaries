<tr><td>1.  So our goal in this video is to take the antiderivative of this fairly crazy looking expression. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>2.  Or another way of saying it is to find the indefinite integral of this crazy looking expression. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  And the key realization right over here is that this expression is made up of a bunch of terms. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  And the indefinite integral of the entire expression is going to be equal to the indefinite integral of each of the terms. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  So this is going to be equal to, we could look at this term right over here, and just take the indefinite integral of that, 7x to the third dx. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000396_000541_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  And then from that, we can subtract the indefinite integral of this thing. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000624_000646_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  So we could say this is, and then minus the indefinite integral of 5 times the square root of x dx. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000657_000760_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  And then we can look at this one right over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000810_000830_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  So then we could say plus the indefinite integral of 18 square root of x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000844_000918_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  Square roots of x, over x to the third dx. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000941_000971_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  And then finally, I'm running out of colors here, finally I need more colors in my thing. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  We can take the antiderivative of this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001066_001082_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  So plus the antiderivative of x to the negative 40th power dx. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001092_001178_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  So I've just rewritten this and color-coded things. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  So let's take the antiderivative of each of these. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  And you'll see that we'll be able to do it using our whatever we want to call it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  The inverse of the power rule, or the anti-power rule, whatever you might want to call it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  So let's look at the first one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  So we have-- what I'm going to do is, I'm just going to find the antiderivative without the constant, and just add the constant at the end. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  For the sake of this one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  Just to make sure we get the most general antiderivative. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  So here the exponent is a 3. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001580_001595_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  So we can increase it by 1. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  So it's going to be x to the 4th. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  Let me do that same purple color, or pink color. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001688_001698_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  It's going to be x to the 4th, or we're going to divide by x to the 4th. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001707_001752_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  So it's x to the 4th over 4 is the antiderivative of x to the 3rd. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  And you just had this scaling quantity, the seven out front. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  So we can still just have the seven out front. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001853_001865_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  So we get 7x to the 4th over 4. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  Fair enough. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  From that, we're going to subtract the antiderivative of this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001957_001963_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  Now at first this might not be obvious, that you could use our inverse power rule, or anti-power rule here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  But then you just need to realize that 5 times the principal root of x is the same thing as 5 times x to the 1/2 power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002172_002243_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  And so once again, the exponent here is 1/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002281_002305_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  We can increment it by 1. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  So it's going to be x to the 3/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002365_002399_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  And then divide by the incremented exponent. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  So divide by 3/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002455_002482_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  And of course we had this 5 out front, so we still want to have the 5 out front. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002507_002533_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  Now this next expression looks even wackier. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  But once again, we can simplify a little bit. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  This is the same thing-- let me do it right over here-- this is the same thing as 18 times x to the 1/2 times x to the negative 3 power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002649_002789_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  x to the 3rd in the denominator is the same thing as x to the negative 3. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  We have the same base, we could just add the exponents. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  So this is going to be equal to 18 times x to the 2 and 1/2 power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002893_002947_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  Or another way of thinking about it, this is the same thing as 18 times x to the 5/2 power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002988_003137_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  Did I do that right? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003144_003165_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  Yeah. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  Negative 3. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  Oh sorry, this is negative 2 and 1/2. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  Let me make this very clear. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003265_003267_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>53.  And this is going to be the negative 5/2 power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003288_003293_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>54.  x to the negative 3 is the same thing as x to the negative 6/2. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>55.  Negative 6/2 plus 1/2 is negative 5/2. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>56.  So once again, we just have to increment this exponent. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003490_003513_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>57.  So negative 5/2 plus 1 is going to be negative 3/2. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>58.  So you're going to have x to the negative 3/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003641_003679_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>59.  And then you divide by what your exponent is when you increment it. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003694_003700_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>60.  So divide it by negative 3/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003733_003763_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>61.  And then you had the 18 out front. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003809_003833_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>62.  And we obviously are going to have to simplify this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>63.  And then finally, our exponent in this term. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003915_003940_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>64.  Let me not use that purple anymore. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>65.  The exponent in this term right over here is negative 40. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003996_004000_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>66.  If we increment it, we get x to the negative 39 power, all of that over negative 39. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004048_004134_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>67.  And now we can add our constant, c. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004139_004203_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>68.  And all we need to do is simplify all of this craziness. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>69.  So the first one is fairly simplified. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>70.  We can write it as 7/4 x to the 4th. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004298_004341_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>71.  Now this term right over here is essentially negative 5 divided by 3/2. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>72.  So 5 over 3/2 is equal to 5 times 2/3, which is equal to 10 over 3. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004438_004546_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>73.  So this thing right over here simplifies to negative 10/3 x to the 3/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004591_004662_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>74.  And then we have all of this craziness. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>75.  Now 18 divided by negative 3/2 is equal to 18 times negative 2/3. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004753_004855_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>76.  Which is equal to, well we can simplify this a little bit, this is the same thing as 6 times negative 2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004939_005021_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>77.  Which is equal to negative 12. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005045_005058_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>78.  So this expression right over here is negative 12x to the negative 3/2. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005093_005153_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>79.  And then finally, this one right over here, we can just rewrite it as, if we want, we could, well, we could just write negative 1/39 x to the negative 39 plus c. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005210_005362_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>80.  And we're done. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>81.  We've found the indefinite integral of all this craziness. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>82.  And I encourage you to take the derivative of this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005428_005457_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>83.  And you can do it using really just the power rule, to take the derivative of this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005475_005488_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>84.  And verify that it does indeed equal this expression that we took the antiderivative of. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005497_005598_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
