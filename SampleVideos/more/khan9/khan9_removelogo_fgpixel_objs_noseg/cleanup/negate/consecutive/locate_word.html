<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So, our goal in this video is to take the antiderivative of this fairly crazy looking expression. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Or another way of saying it is to find the indefinite integral of this crazy looking expression. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And the key realization right over <font color='red'>here </font>is that you, this expression is made up of a bunch of terms. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc2_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And the indefinite integral of the entire expression is going to be equal to the indefinite integral of each of the terms. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to, we could look at this term right over <font color='red'>here </font>and just take the indefinite, take the indefinite integral of that. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc4_word0.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
x to the 3rd dx. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then from that we can subtract the indefinite integral of this thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we can say this is, and then minus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The indefinite integral of 5 times the square root of x d x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we can look at this one right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc9_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So then we can say plus the indefinite integral of 18 square root of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Square roots of x over x to the third, dx and then finally, and I'm running out of colors <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc11_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Finally, I need more colors in my thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We can take the anti derivative of this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So plus the anti derivative of x to the negative 40th power dx. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So, I've just rewritten this and color coded things. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So, let's take the anti derivative of each of these and you'll see that'll we'll be able to do it. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Using our whatever we wanna call the inverse of the power rule or the anti power rule. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Whatever you might wanna call it. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So lets look at the first one. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we have, we have, what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna find the anti derivative without the constant and just add the constant at the end for the sake of this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we just make sure we get the most general anti derivative. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So <font color='red'>here </font>the exponent is a 3. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc22_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we can increase it by 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's going to be x to the 4th. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's gonna be that same purple color. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Or that pink color. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's going to be x to the 4th. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we're gonna divide x to the 4th. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's x to the 4th over 4 is the antiderivative of x to the 3rd, and you just had this scaling quantity. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The 7 out front. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we can still just have 7 out front. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we get 7x to the 4th over 4. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Fair enough. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
From that, we're going to subtract the antiderivative of this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now, at first, this might not be obvious that this, you could use our inverse power rule or anti-power rule <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc35_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But then you just need to realize that 5 times the principal root of x is the same thing as. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So, this is the same thing as 5 x X to the 1 half power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And, so, once again, the exponent <font color='red'>here </font>is one half, we can increment it by 1. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc38_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is going to be X to the 3 halves. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then, divide by the incremented exponent. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So, divide by. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Three halves and of course we had this five out front so we still want to have the five out front. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now this next expression looks even wackier but once again we can simplify a little bit. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is the same thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let me do it right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc45_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is the same thing as 18 times x to the one half times x to the negative three power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
X to the third in the denominator is the same thing as x to the negative three. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We have the same base, we can just add the exponent so this is going to be equal to 18 times x to the 2 and a half power, and a half power or another way of thinking about it, this is the same thing as 18 times x, 18 times x to the 5 halves power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Two the 5 halves power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Did I do that right? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Yeah, negative 3, oh sorry, this is negative 2 and a half let me make this very clear and this is going to be the negative 5 half power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
X to the negative 3 is the same thing as x to the negative 6 halves, negative six halves plus 1 half is negative 5 halves. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So once again we just have to increment this exponent. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So negative 5 halves, plus 1 is going to be negative 3 halves. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So you're going to have x, x to the negative 3 halves, and then you divide by what your exponent is when you increment, so divide it by negative, divide it by negative 3 halves. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then you have the 18 out front. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we obviously are going to have to simplify this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then finally, our exponent in this term, let me not use that purple any more, the exponent, in this term right over <font color='red'>here </font>is negative 40, if we increment we get x to the negative 39 power, all of that over negative 39. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc58_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now we can add our constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now we can add our constant C, and all we need to do is simplify all of this craziness. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the first one is fairly simplified. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We can write it as seven fourths. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
X to the 4th. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now this term right over <font color='red'>here </font>is essentially 5 divided by 3 halves, so 5 over three halves is equal 5 times two thirds, which is equal to 10 over 3. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc64_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this thing right over <font color='red'>here </font>simplifies to negative 10 over 3X to the three halves. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc65_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we have all of this craziness. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now 18 divided by negative three halves. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
divided by negative 3 halves is equal to 18 times. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Negative two thirds, which is equal to, well, we can, we can simplify this a little bit. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is the same thing as 6. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is the same thing as 6 times negative 2 which is equal to negative 12. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So, this expression right over <font color='red'>here, </font>is negative 12 x to the negative 3 halves. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc72_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then finally this one right over <font color='red'>here, </font>we can just rewrite it as. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc73_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If we want, we could, well, we could just write negative one thirty-ninths x to the negative 39. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Plus, plus C, and we're done. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We found the indefinite integral of all of this craziness. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And I encourage you to take the derivative of this, and you can do it using really just the power rule, to take the derivative of this and verify that it does indeed equal this expression that we took, that we took the anti-derivative of.
