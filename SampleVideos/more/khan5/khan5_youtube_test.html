<object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(0)">Let's say I have some function f that is continuous on an interval between a and b. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(11)">And I have these brackets here, so it also includes a and b in the interval. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(14)">So let me graph this just so we get a sense of what I'm talking about. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(18)">So that's my vertical axis. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(20)">This is my horizontal axis. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(22)">I'm going to label my horizontal axis t so we can save x for later. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(26)">I can still make this y right over there. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(28)">And let me graph. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(30)">This right over here is the graph of y is equal to f(t). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(35)">Now our lower endpoint is a, so that's a right over there. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(41)">Our upper boundary is b. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(44)">Let me make that clear. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(47)">And actually just to show that we're including that endpoint, let me make them bold lines, filled in lines. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(52)">So lower boundary, a, upper boundary, b. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(54)">We're just saying and I've drawn it this way that f is continuous on that. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(58)">Now let's define some new function. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(61)">Let's define some new function that's the area under the curve between a and some point that's in our interval. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(70)">Let me pick this right over here, x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(73)">So let's define some new function to capture the area under the curve between a and x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(82)">Well, how do we denote the area under the curve between two endpoints? </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(87)">Well, we just use our definite integral. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(89)">That's our Riemann integral. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(90)">It's really that right now before we come up with the conclusion of this video, it really just represents the area under the curve between two endpoints. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(98)">So this right over here, we can say is the definite integral from a to x of f(t)dt. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(113)">Now this right over here is going to be a function of x-- and let me make it clear-- where x is in the interval between a and b. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(130)">This thing right over here is going to be another function of x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(134)">This value is going to depend on what x we actually choose. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(138)">So let's define this as a function of x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(141)">So I'm going to say that this is equal to uppercase F(x). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(146)">So all fair and good. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(149)">Uppercase F(x) is a function. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(151)">If you give me an x value that's between a and b, it'll tell you the area under lowercase f(t) between a and x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(160)">Now the cool part, the fundamental theorem of calculus. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(165)">The fundamental theorem of calculus tells us-- let me write this down because this is a big deal. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(170)">Fundamental theorem-- that's not an abbreviation-- theorem of calculus tells us that if we were to take the derivative of our capital F, so the derivative-- let me make sure I have enough space here. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(186)">So if I were to take the derivative of capital F with respect to x, which is the same thing as taking the derivative of this with respect to x, which is equal to the derivative of all of this business-- let me copy this. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(198)">So copy and then paste, which is the same thing. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(204)">I've defined capital F as this stuff. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(206)">So if I'm taking the derivative of the left hand side, it's the same thing as taking the derivative of the right hand side. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(211)">The fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this is going to be equal to lowercase f(x). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(222)">Now why is this a big deal? </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(226)">Why does it get such an important title as the fundamental theorem of calculus? </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(234)">Well, it tells us that for any continuous function f, if I define a function, that is, the area under the curve between a and x right over here, that the derivative of that function is going to be f. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(248)">So let me make it clear. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(249)">Every continuous function, every continuous f, has an antiderivative capital F(x). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(260)">That by itself is a cool thing. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(266)">But the other really cool thing-- or I guess these are somewhat related. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(272)">Remember, coming into this, all we did, we just viewed the definite integral as symbolizing as the area under the curve between two points. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(281)">That's where that Riemann definition of integration comes from. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(285)">But now we see a connection between that and derivatives. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(289)">When you're taking the definite integral, one way of thinking, especially if you're taking a definite integral between a lower boundary and an x, one way to think about it is you're essentially taking an antiderivative. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(298)">So we now see a connection-- and this is why it is the fundamental theorem of calculus. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(304)">It connects differential calculus and integral calculus-- connection between derivatives, or maybe I should say antiderivatives, derivatives and integration. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(317)">Which before this video, we just viewed integration as area under curve. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(321)">Now we see it has a connection to derivatives. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(324)">Well, how would you actually use the fundamental theorem of calculus? </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(327)">Well, maybe in the context of a calculus class. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(330)">And we'll do the intuition for why this happens or why this is true and maybe a proof in later videos. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(335)">But how would you actually apply this right over here? </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(338)">Well, let's say someone told you that they want to find the derivative. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(343)">Let me do this in a new color just to show this is an example. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(346)">Let's say someone wanted to find the derivative with respect to x of the integral from-- I don't know. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(352)">I'll pick some random number here. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(354)">So pi to x-- I'll put something crazy here-- cos^2(t)/ln(t-sqrt(t))dt. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(370)">So they want you take the derivative with respect to x of this crazy thing. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(375)">Remember, this thing in the parentheses is a function of x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(378)">Its value, it's going to have a value that is dependent on x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(381)">If you give it a different x, it's going to have a different value. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(384)">So what's the derivative of this with respect to x? </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(386)">Well, the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us it can be very simple. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(390)">We essentially-- and you can even pattern match up here. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(394)">And we'll get more intuition of why this is true in future videos. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(397)">But essentially, everywhere where you see this right over here is an f(t). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(400)">Everywhere you see a t, replace it with an x and it becomes an f(x). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(406)">So this is going to be equal to cos^(x)/ln(x-sqrt(x)). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(413)">You take the derivative of the indefinite integral where the upper boundary is x right over here. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(418)">It just becomes whatever you were taking the integral of, that as a function instead of t, that is now a function x. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(427)">So it can really simplify sometimes taking a derivative. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(430)">And sometimes you'll see on exams these trick problems where you had this really hairy thing that you need to take a definite integral of and then take the derivative, and you just have to remember the fundamental theorem of calculus, the thing that ties it all together, connects derivatives and integration, that you can just simplify it by realizing that this is just going to be instead of a function lowercase f(t), it's going to be lowercase f(x). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(451)">Let me make it clear. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(452)">In this example right over here, this right over here was lowercase f(t). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(457)">And now it became lowercase f(x). </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(461)">This right over here was our a. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(465)">And notice, it doesn't matter what the lower boundary of a actually is. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(468)">You don't have anything on the right hand side that is in some way dependent on a. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(472)">Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. </br>
</object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(473)">And in the next few videos, we'll think about the intuition and do more examples making use of the fundamental theorem of calculus. </br>
