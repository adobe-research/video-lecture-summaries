<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's say I have some function f that is continuous on an interval between a and b. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And I have these brackets <font color='red'>here, </font>so it also includes a and b in the interval. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc1_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let me graph this just so we get a sense of what I'm talking about. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So that's my vertical axis. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is my horizontal axis. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I'm going to label my horizontal axis t so we can save x for later. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I can still make this y right over there. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And let me graph. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This right over <font color='red'>here </font>is the graph of y is equal to f of t. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc8_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now our lower endpoint is a, so that's a right over there. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Our upper boundary is b. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let me make that clear. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And actually just to show that we're including that endpoint, let me make them bold lines, filled in lines. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So lower boundary, a, upper boundary, b. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We're just saying and I've drawn it this way that f is continuous on that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now let's define some new function. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's define some new function that's the area under the curve between a and some point that's in our interval. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let me pick this right over <font color='red'>here, </font>x. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc17_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's define some new function to capture the area under the curve between a and x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, how do we denote the area under the curve between two endpoints? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, we just use our definite integral. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
That's our Riemann integral. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's really that right now before we come up with the conclusion of this video, it really just represents the area under the curve between two endpoints. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this right over <font color='red'>here, </font>we can say is the definite integral from a to x of f of t dt. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc23_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now this right over <font color='red'>here </font>is going to be a function of x-- and let me make it clear-- where x is in the interval between a and b. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc24_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This thing right over <font color='red'>here </font>is going to be another function of x. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc25_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This value is going to depend on what x we actually choose. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's define this as a function of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So I'm going to say that this is equal to uppercase F of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So all fair and good. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Uppercase F of x is a function. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you give me an x value that's between a and b, it'll tell you the area under lowercase f of t between a and x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now the cool part, the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The fundamental theorem of calculus tells us-- let me write this down because this is a big deal. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Fundamental theorem-- that's not an abbreviation-- theorem of calculus tells us that if we were to take the derivative of our capital F, so the derivative-- let me make sure I have enough space <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc34_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So if I were to take the derivative of capital F with respect to x, which is the same thing as taking the derivative of this with respect to x, which is equal to the derivative of all of this business-- let me copy this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So copy and then paste, which is the same thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I've defined capital F as this stuff. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So if I'm taking the derivative of the left hand side, it's the same thing as taking the derivative of the right hand side. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this is going to be equal to lowercase f of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now why is this a big deal? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Why does it get such an important title as the fundamental theorem of calculus? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, it tells us that for any continuous function f, if I define a function, that is, the area under the curve between a and x right over <font color='red'>here, </font>that the derivative of that function is going to be f. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc42_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let me make it clear. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Every continuous function, every continuous f, has an antiderivative capital F of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
That by itself is a cool thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But the other really cool thing-- or I guess these are somewhat related. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Remember, coming into this, all we did, we just viewed the definite integral as symbolizing as the area under the curve between two points. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
That's where that Riemann definition of integration comes from. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But now we see a connection between that and derivatives. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
When you're taking the definite integral, one way of thinking, especially if you're taking a definite integral between a lower boundary and an x, one way to think about it is you're essentially taking an antiderivative. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we now see a connection-- and this is why it is the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It connects differential calculus and integral calculus-- connection between derivatives, or maybe I should say antiderivatives, derivatives and integration. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Which before this video, we just viewed integration as area under curve. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now we see it has a connection to derivatives. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, how would you actually use the fundamental theorem of calculus? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, maybe in the context of a calculus class. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we'll do the intuition for why this happens or why this is true and maybe a proof in later videos. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But how would you actually apply this right over here? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, let's say someone told you that they want to find the derivative. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let me do this in a new color just to show this is an example. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's say someone wanted to find the derivative with respect to x of the integral from-- I don't know. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I'll pick some random number <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc62_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So pi 2x-- I'll put something crazy here-- cosine squared of t over the natural log of t minus the square root of t dt. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So they want you take the derivative with respect to x of this crazy thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Remember, this thing in the parentheses is a function of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Its value, it's going to have a value that is dependent on x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you give it a different x, it's going to have a different value. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So what's the derivative of this with respect to x? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us it can be very simple. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We essentially-- and you can even pattern match up <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc70_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we'll get more intuition of why this is true in future videos. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But essentially, everywhere where you see this right over <font color='red'>here </font>is an f of t. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc72_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Everywhere you see a t, replace it with an x and it becomes an f of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to cosine squared of x over the natural log of x minus the square root of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You take the derivative of the indefinite integral where the upper boundary is x right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc75_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It just becomes whatever you were taking the integral of, that as a function instaed of t, that is now a function x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it can really simplify sometimes taking a derivative. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And sometimes you'll see on exams these trick problems where you had this really hairy thing that you need to take a definite integral of and then take the derivative, and you just have to remember the fundamental theorem of calculus, the thing that ties it all together, connects derivatives and integration, that you can just simplify it by realizing that this is just going to be instead of a function lowercase f of t, it's going to be lowercase f of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let me make it clear. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
In this example right over <font color='red'>here, </font>this right over <font color='red'>here </font>was lowercase f of t. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc80_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<img src= "locate_word/stc80_word1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now it became lowercase f of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This right over <font color='red'>here </font>was our a. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc82_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And notice, it doesn't matter what the lower boundary of a actually is. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You don't have anything on the right hand side that is in some way dependent on a. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And in the next few videos, we'll think about the intuition and do more examples making use of the fundamental theorem of calculus.
