That's where that Riemann definition of integration comes from. But now we see a connection between that and derivatives. When you're taking the definite integral, one way of thinking, especially if you're taking a definite integral between a lower boundary and an x, one way to think about it is you're essentially taking an antiderivative. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig9').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_004747_004810_group_004501_004552.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig9').src='line_figures/obj_004044_004810_group.png'" >So we now see a connection-- and this is why it is the fundamental theorem of calculus. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig9').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_004747_004810_group_004621_004705.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig9').src='line_figures/obj_004044_004810_group.png'" >It connects differential calculus and integral calculus-- connection between derivatives, or maybe I should say antiderivatives, derivatives and integration. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig9').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_004747_004810_group_004747_004810.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig9').src='line_figures/obj_004044_004810_group.png'" >Which before this video, we just viewed integration as area under curve. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we see it has a connection to derivatives. Well, how would you actually use the fundamental theorem of calculus? Well, maybe in the context of a calculus class. And we'll do the intuition for why this happens or why this is true and maybe a proof in later videos. But how would you actually apply this right over here? Well, let's say someone told you that they want to find the derivative. Let me do this in a new color just to show this is an example. </p><figure>
