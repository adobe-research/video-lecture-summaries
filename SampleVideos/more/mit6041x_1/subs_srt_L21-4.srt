In this segment we
develop some consequences

3

of the independence
assumption that we

4

have made on the trials that
constitute a Bernoulli process.

5

These properties will
be pretty intuitive,

6

but they play an important role.

7

They're helpful in
solving problems,

8

and they're also quite
helpful in understanding

9

the continuous time version of
the Bernoulli process, namely

10

the Poisson process that
we will be studying later.

11

So here's the story.

12

We start with a
Bernoulli processes

13

with some parameter p.

14


15

The process starts.

16

A friend of yours
watches the processes,

17

and they observe the results
of the different trials,

18

let's say for five time steps.

19

And at this time,
right after time five,

20

they call you into
the room, and you

21

start watching the
rest of the process.

22

What will you see?

23

The first random variable
that you will see

24

is the result of whatever
happens in this time

25

slot, which is the sixth
slot of the original process.

26

The second random
variable that you will see

27

is the result of the
seventh random variable

28

in the original
process, and so on.

29

So the process
that you get to see

30

is the process
Yi, where i ranges

31

over the non-negative integers.

32

What properties does
this process have?

33

Because of the assumption
that the different trials are

34

independent, this means
that the first five trials

35

are independent from the trials
that happen after time five.

36

So one property is
that the process

37

is Yi is independent
of whatever happens

38

in the past, which
is X1 up to X5.

39

Second, the random variable
that you see, X6, X7, and so on,

40

are independent Bernoulli random
variables with parameter p.

41

So the random variables
Yi constitute also

42

a Bernoulli process
with parameter p.

43

So the process that
you get to see,

44

which is the sequence of
trials after time five,

45

is identical, probabilistically,
to a Bernoulli process

46

with parameter p
like the process Xi.

47

So it's as if a Bernoulli
process was just

48

starting fresh at
this particular time.

49

And because of this,
we say that the process

50

has a fresh-start property
after a certain time.

51

In this example, we used
5 as the certain time,

52

but instead of 5, we could
have any particular integer

53

little n, in which case
our process Y1 starts

54

with Xn plus 1, continues
with Xn plus 2 and so on.

55

And here, instead of X5,
we would have written Xn.

56

So after a deterministic
time n, what you see

57

is the same as if we had
a Bernoulli process that

58

was starting fresh at
this particular time,

59

and which is also
independent from whatever

60

happened in the past.

61

Let us now complicate
the story a little bit.

62

Suppose that your friend
watches the Bernoulli process,

63

and they keep watching
it until a success is

64

observed for the first time.

65

Right at that time, they
call you into the room,

66

and you started watching
the rest of the process.

67

This is the length
of time that we

68

have called T1, the number of
trials until the first success.

69

So what is it that
you will be watching?

70

The first random variable
that you will see

71

is what happens
in slot T1 plus 1.

72

The second random
variable that you will see

73

is what happened in slot
T1 plus 2, and so on.

74

And this defines,
again, a process,

75

the sequence of the
Yi's This is what

76

you will see starting
from this particular time.

77

What kind of process is it?

78

Well, these trials
happened in the past.

79

We know what they were.

80

But no matter what they
were, the future trials

81

will still be
independent of the past,

82

and each one of the
trials will have

83

probability p of
being a success.

84

So the properties
that we have, again,

85

is that the trials
that you see are

86

independent of the
past, which in this case

87

is everything from
x1 up to time xT1.

88

And what you see is
a Bernoulli process.

89

We describe the
situation by saying

90

that the process starts
fresh after time T1.

91

And by this, again,
we mean that if you

92

start watching the process right
after T1, what you will see

93

will be a Bernoulli
process which

94

is independent from whatever
happened in the past.

95

Having just argued
that the process starts

96

fresh at the time T1
of the first success,

97

we can now ask why whether
such a property is also true

98

more generally.

99

That is, if we start watching
the process at some random time

100

n, will the process
start fresh at that time?

101

Let us look at some
additional examples.

102

Suppose that capital N is the
time of the third success.

103

So your friend watches
the Bernoulli process,

104

and each time, they say,
did the third success occur?

105

Not yet.

106

Not yet.

107

Not yet.

108

Not yet.

109

Yes, the third
success just occurred.

110

And at that time, they
call you into the room

111

and you start to watching what
happens from that time on.

112

What will you be seeing?

113

After that time, there will be
independent Bernoulli trials

114

that take place.

115

And these refer to the future
of the process, looking at [it]

116

from this particular
point in time.

117

And the future is
independent from whatever

118

happened in the past.

119

So what you actually see is,
indeed, a fresh Bernoulli

120

process that starts
here and which

121

is independent from the
random variables that

122

occurred in the past.

123

Let us look at another example.

124

Let capital N be the first time
that three successes in a row

125

have been recorded.

126

So your friend, again,
watches the process.

127

And they ask each time, did
we see three success in a row?

128

Not yet.

129

Not yet.

130

Not yet.

131

Not yet.

132

Not yet.

133

Yes.

134

I just saw three
successes in a row.

135

And now your friend
calls you in,

136

and you start
watching the process

137

from this point in time.

138

By the same argument
as before, whatever

139

happens in the future is going
to be Bernoulli trials that

140

are independent from the
past, so you will, again,

141

have a fresh-start property
starting from this time.

142

So in both cases,
formally, what we have

143

is that the process that you get
to observe starting after time

144

capital N, after the time
that you're called and asked

145

to start watching,
what you will see

146

is going to be a sequence of
independent Bernoulli trials,

147

that is, a Bernoulli process.

148

And this sequence
of future trials

149

is independent from
whatever happened

150

in the past of the process.

151

What both of these
examples have in common

152

is that the random variable
N, the time at which you're

153

called in, is
causally determined

154

from the history of the process.

155

What does that mean?

156

It means that somebody
is watching the process,

157

and at each point in time, based
on what they have seen so far,

158

they decide whether
to call you in or not.

159

What would be an example
of a non-causal time N?

160

Here it is.

161

N could be the time just before
the first occurrence of 1,

162

1, 1.

163

So in this example here, you
would be called into the room

164

and start watching at this time.

165

So your friend somehow knows
that a sequence of 1,1, 1

166

is going to occur and calls
you just before it happens.

167

How could that be?

168

Well, imagine that the
Bernoulli process actually

169

was run yesterday.

170

It was recorded in a movie.

171

Your friend has seen
the movie, so knows

172

everything that's
going to happen.

173

And so, when the movie
is replayed today,

174

your friend can call you in
at this time and tell you,

175

you know, something very
interesting is about happen.

176

Come in and start watching.

177

Now, what will you be watching?

178

What you will watch will
be 1, 1, 1, with certainty.

179

You're certain that the first
three trials that you will see

180

will be 1's.

181

And, well, the subsequent
one's will be random.

182

But since you know that the
first three trials will be 1,

183

this means that
statistically, they're

184

not described by the statistics
of a Bernoulli process.

185

In a Bernoulli
process, each trial

186

has a probability of being 1
and the probability of being 0.

187

But since, in your case,
you're certain to watch

188

1's in the beginning, this
means that the random variables

189

that you see do not conform to
the description of a Bernoulli

190

process.

191

So this is an example in which
N is not causally determined.

192


193

And in this example,
you do not to get

194

to see a Bernoulli process.

195

We do not have the
fresh-start property.

196

What happened here is
more generally true.

197

We do have a fresh-start
property, but not always.

198

We have it under the assumption
that the time at which you're

199

asked to start
watching is determined

200

from the past history of the
process in some causal manner.

201

This is a general fact that
can be established rigorously.

202

However we will not go through a
formal mathematical derivation.

203

The formal argument for
the most general case

204

involves somewhat tedious
symbol manipulations

205

that do not provide
any additional insight.

206

However, the intuition
behind this result

207

should be fairly clear,
and we will use it freely

208

whenever we need it.

209
