In this segment we develop some consequences of the independence assumption that we have made on the trials that constitute a Bernoulli process.

These properties will be pretty intuitive, but they play an important role.

They're helpful in solving problems, and they're also quite helpful in understanding the continuous time version of the Bernoulli process, namely the Poisson process that we will be studying later.

<tr><td><p>
So here's the story. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
We start with a Bernoulli processes with some parameter p.

A friend of yours watches the processes, and they observe the results of the different trials, let's say for five time steps. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
And at this time, right after time five, they call you into the room, and you start watching the rest of the process. 
</p></td>

<img src= "obj_001050_001753_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
What will you see? The first random variable that you will see is the result of whatever happens in this time slot, which is the sixth slot of the original process. 
</p></td>

The second random variable that you will see is the result of the seventh random variable in the original process, and so on.

<tr><td><p>
So the process that you get to see is the process Yi, where i ranges over the non-negative integers. 
</p></td>

<img src= "obj_000819_002687_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
What properties does this process have? Because of the assumption that the different trials are independent, this means that the first five trials are independent from the trials that happen after time five. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001050_002704_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
So one property is that the process is Yi is independent of whatever happens in the past, which is X1 up to X5. 
</p></td>

<img src= "obj_000819_003572_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
Second, the random variable that you see, X6, X7, and so on, are independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter p. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
So the random variables Yi constitute also a Bernoulli process with parameter p.

<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So the process that you get to see, which is the sequence of trials after time five, is identical, probabilistically, to a Bernoulli process with parameter p like the process Xi. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001050_004207_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

<tr><td><p>
So it's as if a Bernoulli process was just starting fresh at this particular time. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
And because of this, we say that the process has a fresh-start property after a certain time. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_004848_004851_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
In this example, we used 5 as the certain time, but instead of 5, we could have any particular integer little n, in which case our process Y1 starts with Xn plus 1, continues with Xn plus 2 and so on. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_000819_005653_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

<tr><td><p>
And here, instead of X5, we would have written Xn.

<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So after a deterministic time n, what you see is the same as if we had a Bernoulli process that was starting fresh at this particular time, and which is also independent from whatever happened in the past. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
Let us now complicate the story a little bit. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
Suppose that your friend watches the Bernoulli process, and they keep watching it until a success is observed for the first time.

Right at that time, they call you into the room, and you started watching the rest of the process.

<figcaption>  </figcaption>

</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
This is the length of time that we have called T1, the number of trials until the first success. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_004848_007055_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So what is it that you will be watching? The first random variable that you will see is what happens in slot T1 plus 1. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_004848_007455_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
The second random variable that you will see is what happened in slot T1 plus 2, and so on. 
</p></td>

<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
And this defines, again, a process, the sequence of the Yi's This is what you will see starting from this particular time. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
What kind of process is it? Well, these trials happened in the past. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
We know what they were. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
But no matter what they were, the future trials will still be independent of the past, and each one of the trials will have probability p of being a success. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So the properties that we have, again, is that the trials that you see are independent of the past, which in this case is everything from x1 up to time xT1. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
We describe the situation by saying that the process starts fresh after time T1.

And by this, again, we mean that if you start watching the process right after T1, what you will see will be a Bernoulli process which is independent from whatever happened in the past.

Having just argued that the process starts of the first success, we can now ask why whether such a property is also true more generally.

That is, if we start watching the process at some random time n, will the process start fresh at that time? Let us look at some additional examples.

So in both cases, formally, what we have is that the process that you get to observe starting after time capital N, after the time that you're called and asked to start watching, what you will see is going to be a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, that is, a Bernoulli process.

What both of these examples have in common is that the random variable N, the time at which you're called in, is causally determined from the history of the process.
