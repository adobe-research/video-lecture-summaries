0:01G'day and welcome to the TecMath channel. In this video today we are looking at the fast
0:05way of multiplying two
0:06two digit numbers together....so let's go!
0:09First of all we'll see if you can multiply some numbers together
0:12I'll give you a question which is
0:14twenty-one
0:15times
0:17thirty one. I'll give you six seconds to work that out. Go!
0:25So time's up.
0:26So if you got the answer of 651 you did really really well
0:30you got the right answer
0:31If you were busily reaching for the calculator but couldn't find it in time bad luck
0:35but you shouldn't need a calculator, and I'll show you how to work it out quickly
0:39Don't get all despondant if you didn't work it out I'll show you how to work these out
0:45So to get the first number of our answer we multiply the first
0:49digits in our two numbers here, so 2 x 3
0:53is six, and we have the first part of our answer
0:56We leave a blank space.
0:58To get the last number of our answer
1:00we multiply the last digits of our two numbers here So 1 x 1 is 1.
1:08To get the middle part of this number here there is a bit of a trick. What we do
1:12is multiply
1:13this number and this number
1:15and this number and this number and we add the two answers together
1:19so 1 x 2 is 2 1 x 3 is 3
1:22we add 2 and 3 together and get the answer
1:25six hundred fifty one
1:27Hey, pretty easy 'eh?
1:29We'll have a look at another one
1:35So, what about 43
1:38times 21, a little bit harder this time
1:41See how you go. Have you got the answer yet?
1:47I'll start working through this one.
1:49So again
1:504 x 2 is 8
1:52We leave the blank space
1:541 x 3 = 3
1:57Then what we do is go...
1:59remember this....
2:001 x 4, and we add this to 3 x 2 so
2:041 x 4 is 4
2:063 x 2
2:07is 6
2:08We add these together
2:09We get the answer of 10
2:12Now this leads to a problem, so this is a little trick for to understand
2:16There is only one space here We only have space to fit one digit
2:21So the digit it puts in out of this ten
2:23is the zero, and for the one
2:26We carry this across
2:28And we add it on, so
2:30The answer we end up getting
2:311 + 8 is
2:339
2:340
2:353...nine hundred and three.
2:38Very good. I think we can go through one more
2:41I'll rub that out and
2:43let's have a look one more question
2:47I think this time I'll do it in a nice
2:49purple colour
2:51and I'll do the question here
2:5442
2:55times
2:5763
2:58I'm going all out, using different colours today, getting excited
3:02Too excited, I can't wait to get the answer - let's work it out
3:06First number 4 x6 Leave a space.
3:08is 24. Leave a space.
3:122 x 3 is 6
3:16And then what we do
3:16And I hope not to get this wrong. I had to remake the video earlier
3:21as I stuffed up this one
3:22Occassionally
3:23I get all excited and I make mistakes too.
3:27But for YouTube videos we don't make mistake. We always get 100% correct
3:30OK
3:31OK
3:33We multiply
3:35These two guys together. 4 x 3 is 12
3:376 x 2 is 12
3:39And 12 + 12 is 24. We add 24 on, OK?
3:45We put the 4 there and 2 there.
3:48So what answer did we get?
3:50Two thousan
3:52six hundred
3:54and forty six
3:57Hey that's the right answer. Pretty cool right?
4:01So if you practice these
4:02you will get really good at them and really fast. Your teacher will be
4:06utterly astounded about how good you are. Everyone will think
4:10your a genius alright?
4:13I mean don't go too far - people might stop talking to you
4:16but hey -
4:18you do this, you'll do really well.
4:20And yes you may make a few mistakes. We all make them.
4:23So finally I will leave you with a few questions
4:28I'll write them, get you to pause the video and work through them, then I'll work through
4:32the answers as quick as I can. Here they are.
4:4022
4:42times 34
4:44I mean 32
4:45see how you go on that one
4:47fifty-one times
4:49sixty three
4:52and 82
4:54times
4:55fifty-one
4:58pause the video
5:00Then I'll get back to you
5:02A couple of seconds and we'll go through these.
5:07OK so hopefully you've worked through those
5:09and we'll go through the answers right now.
5:11OK so
5:132 x 3 is 6
5:16We leave the blank space. 2 x 2 is 4 and then we add four
5:22and six together
5:24which is ten. We get the answer 704
5:29The next one
5:325 x 6
5:34is 30
5:35Leave a space
5:371 x 3 is 3
5:40and then we get
5:41the number 3 x 5 is 15, 1 x 6 is
5:456
5:4615 plus 6
5:47is 21, so I'll put that in a different colour so it fits
5:51This will be a one, and this will be a 2 so our answer is
5:55three thousand
5:56two hundred and thirteen
5:59On to the last one
6:015 x 8
6:02is forty
6:03Leave a blank space
6:051 x 2 is 2
6:07then we go 1 x 8 and we add that to 10
6:118 plus 10
6:12is 18 - we put the 8 there and the one there.
6:15So our answer is four thousand
6:19one hundred and eighty two
6:21I hope you did well on those. See you next time
