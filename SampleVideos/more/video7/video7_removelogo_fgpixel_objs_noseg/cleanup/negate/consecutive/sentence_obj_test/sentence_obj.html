<tr><td>1.  Welcome back to Anton Math. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>2.  In this video, we're going to be talking about some of our basic set operations, the most common set operations that we use when we're talking about sets. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  Let's let S, T, and R be sets. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000165_000203_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  I'm not sure I'm going to use R, but just in case. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000207_000240_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  Now, the first operation I want to talk about is called the Union. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  It's just called union. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000292_000327_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  We denote a union, say S union T in this way. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000331_000371_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  It's kind of this U. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  It's not actually a U, it's more like a cup kind of symbol. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  You can have a set called U, and it will look a little bit different. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000373_000459_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  Inside notation, what this is defined as, this is going to be all of the elements X, where X is an element of S or X is an element of T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000464_000747_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  Pretty much, we're gluing these two sets together. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  We're taking all of the elements of S and all of the elements of T and making a new set that just contains any element that's in one or the other. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  Now, remember, this is mathematical or. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  Let's just say two was in S and in T, two would still be in here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  It's not an exclusive or. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  It includes the case, where X is in both, S and T. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  My only requirement is that it's in at least one of them. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  We also have an opposite idea in a certain sense, the intersection. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000984_001076_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  Now, the intersection of sets, let me denote this S intersection T, it's like the union sign, but upside down. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001085_001148_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  That's going to be defined as all of the elements X, where X is in S and X is in T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001150_001265_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  Remember, this is or, this is and. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  My requirement here is that it's in both. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  If it's in S and it's not in T, then it's not going to be in the intersection. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  The intersection is the set of all common elements between the two sets, S and T. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  Now, we also have a difference. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001422_001488_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  The difference can be denoted a couple of different ways. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  Sometimes you'll see it S minus T, but this is the same thing as S and then it's kind of forward slash T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001493_001566_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  What this means is, this is going to be the set of all of elements that are in S and are not in T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001569_001672_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  All of the X, where X is in S, and X is not in T. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  Basically, we're taking the entire set S and then we're removing any elements from S that happen to be in T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001702_001821_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  Then, one last operation we can talk about is called the complement. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001938_001999_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  Now, this is denoted a couple of different ways. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  I could write this with S with a bar. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002073_002093_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  Sometimes, it'll be S with this tilde on top of it. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002104_002134_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  Sometimes, it'll be S with this little C. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002140_002157_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  Depends on what text you're using. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002159_002217_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  These all mean S complement. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  S complement, this is going to be with respect to a particular universe we talked about in the last video. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  We talked about universe. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  This is defined to be the universe and then I take out everything that's in S. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002283_002355_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  In other words, this is the set of all X in whatever universe I'm talking about. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002370_002411_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  Maybe that universe is rational numbers, maybe that universe is real numbers, whatever it is I'm talking about, where X is specifically not in S. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002492_002547_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  Any other X will do as long as it's within that relative universe. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  A couple of notes real quick now that we have terminology. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  Of note that I can write this S T, I could write this as S intersected with T complement. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002654_002744_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  You see that. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  Everything in S that's not in T, that's the same thing here, this is everything in S that's also in T complement or that's also part of the set of things that are not in T. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  This is an equivalent idea. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  We say that if S intersection T is equal to the null set. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002952_003042_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  In other words, if S and T have nothing in common, S and T are called disjoint. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003045_003198_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  These are disjoint sets. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>53.  For example, the set of all chairs and the set of all bowling balls are disjoint sets. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>54.  There's no chair that's a bowling ball unless somebody's made one that I don't know about. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>55.  We call those disjoint. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>56.  There are two sets that have no commonality, none of their elements are shared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>57.  I've gone over a lot of terminology. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>58.  Let's go ahead and do a quick example before I end this video and go onto the properties of these operations. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>59.  Let's just say my S is equal to one, two, three and my T is equal to two, four, five. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003474_003644_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>60.  Given this, we can calculate out some of these things. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>61.  My S intersection T, remember that's going to be all of the elements that are in both, S and T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003666_003703_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>62.  That's going to be the set containing only the element two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003725_003743_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>63.  We see that one and three are not in T, so two is the only element that's in both, S and T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003745_003815_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>64.  Now, remember the union is going to be all elements that are in S or T, so one, two, three, four, five. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003840_003991_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>65.  This is why I keep saying this is like gluing these together. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>66.  This is the set of all elements that are just in one of these sets, and we take out any repetition. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>67.  Two is in both, but I'm not going to write two twice. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>68.  We know that, with sets in general, we don't include any repetition. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>69.  The difference S T, that's going to be equal to all of the elements in S that are not in T. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004096_004160_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>70.  In other words, one and three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004200_004228_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>71.  The difference, T-S, that's going to be all the elements in T that are not in S, so four and five because they share that two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004230_004318_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>72.  Something you need to know, notice if I had this S T union with T-S, that's going to be the elements one, three, four, five. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004348_004496_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>73.  That's the same thing as the union of S and T minus the intersection of S and T, isn't it? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004500_004614_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>74.  It's kind of interesting. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>75.  We call this an identity. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>76.  This is something that's an identity. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>77.  In the next video, I'm going to go over a lot of our set operation rules, a lot of these identities so we can use these tools to simplify the same way that we would use an algebra to simplify an algebraic statement. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>78.  We can have these long strings of these set operations and we can use some of these rules in the next video to simplify these strings into something much more compact, much more simple. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>79.  Will see you there. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
