<p>Welcome back to ant on math and the City. Oh we're gonna be talking about some other basic set operations. The most common set operation that we use when we're talking about sets. So what sort of. let's start off. </p><figure>

<p>Now the first operation i wanna talk about is called the union and just called Union. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_000642_000747_group_000292_000371.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures/obj_000292_000747_group.png'" >And we can only union say as Union tee in this way it's kinda issue. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not actually a U it's more like a Cup kinda symbol. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_000642_000747_group_000373_000478.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures/obj_000292_000747_group.png'" >I you can have a set called you an adequate little bit different but in senate ation what this is defined as. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_000642_000747_group_000480_000747.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures/obj_000292_000747_group.png'" >This is going to be all of the elements S where acts is an element ass and X is an element up up sorry that backwards X is now a minute ass or X is an element ft writes this is pretty much for gluing these two sets together working all the elements ass and all the elements have tea and making a new set they just contains any element that's in one or the other now remember this is mathematical or. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So let's just say you know to was an ass and in key to would still be in here read it it's not exclusive or I it includes the case where access and both s and T. My only requirement is that it and at least one of them right. </p><figure>

<p>Now we also have a difference. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_001702_001821_group_001422_001488.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/obj_001422_001821_group.png'" >The difference can be denied it a couple different ways. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_001702_001821_group_001493_001566.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/obj_001422_001821_group.png'" >Sometimes you'll see it s minus T this is the same thing as ass and its kinda forward slash T. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_001702_001821_group_001569_001672.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/obj_001422_001821_group.png'" >And what this means is this is going to be the set of all about a month better in ass and are not in T writes all the X where X is an ass and axe is not in T. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_001702_001821_group_001702_001821.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig3').src='line_figures/obj_001422_001821_group.png'" >So basically we're taking the entire set ass and in Peru moving any elements from ass that happened to be in T. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then I'm one last a yeah one last kind of operation talk about called the compliment. </p><figure>

Right we talked about the last thirty we talked about universe. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig4').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002492_002547_group_002283_002355.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig4').src='line_figures/obj_001938_002547_group.png'" >But this is defined to be the universe and then I take out everything that's in ass right. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig4').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002492_002547_group_002370_002411.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig4').src='line_figures/obj_001938_002547_group.png'" >So in other words this is the setup all X in whatever universe I'm talking about. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So maybe the universe is rational numbers maybe our universe is real numbers. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig4').src='line_figures/highlight/obj_002492_002547_group_002492_002547.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig4').src='line_figures/obj_001938_002547_group.png'" >know whatever it is I'm talking about where axe is specifically not an ass. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right so any other s will do as long as its you know within that relative universe so couple and now it's real quick now we have some terminology. </p><figure>

This is an equivalent idea. </p><figure>

Recovers destroying an answer to sets that have no commonality none of their elements are shared campaigns and I've gone over a lot of terminology. Let's go into a quick example before I and this video and go onto the property is that these operations. </p><figure>

Now we call this an identity right this is something that's and identity. And in the next video I'm gonna go over a lot of our set operation rules allowed these identities. So we can kind of and use these tools to simplify the same way that we would use an algebra to simplify algebraic statement we can have these long strings up the set operations and waking me some these rules for the next video to simplify the strengths into something much more compact. Much more simple. Alright. We will see you there </p>
