<h1>2.2.2 - Set Operations </h1><br>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Welcome back to Anton Math. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In this video, we're going to be talking about some of our basic set operations, the most common set operations that we use when we're talking about sets. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Let's let S, T, and R be sets. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
I'm not sure I'm going to use R, but just in case. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, the first operation I want to talk about is called the Union. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's just called union. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We denote a union, say S union T in this way. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's kind of this U. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's not actually a U, it's more like a cup kind of symbol. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
You can have a set called U, and it will look a little bit different. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Inside notation, what this is defined as, this is going to be all of the elements X, where X is an element of S or X is an element of T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Pretty much, we're gluing these two sets together. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We're taking all of the elements of S and all of the elements of T and making a new set that just contains any element that's in one or the other. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, remember, this is mathematical or. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Let's just say two was in S and in T, two would still be in <font color='red'>here. </font></div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's not an exclusive or. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It includes the case, where X is in both, S and T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
My only requirement is that it's in at least one of them. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We also have an opposite idea in a certain sense, the intersection. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, the intersection of sets, let me denote this S intersection T, it's like the union sign, but upside down. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That's going to be defined as all of the elements X, where X is in S and X is in T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Remember, this is or, this is and. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
My requirement <font color='red'>here </font>is that it's in both. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
If it's in S and it's not in T, then it's not going to be in the intersection. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The intersection is the set of all common elements between the two sets, S and T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, we also have a difference. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The difference can be denoted a couple of different ways. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Sometimes you'll see it S minus T, but this is the same thing as S and then it's kind of forward slash T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
What this means is, this is going to be the set of all of elements that are in S and are not in T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
All of the X, where X is in S, and X is not in T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Basically, we're taking the entire set S and then we're removing any elements from S that happen to be in T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Then, one last operation we can talk about is called the complement. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, this is denoted a couple of different ways. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
I could write this with S with a bar. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Sometimes, it'll be S with this tilde on top of it. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Sometimes, it'll be S with this little C. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Depends on what text you're using. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
These all mean S complement. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
S complement, this is going to be with respect to a particular universe we talked about in the last video. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We talked about universe. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This is defined to be the universe and then I take out everything that's in S. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In other words, this is the set of all X in whatever universe I'm talking about. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Maybe that universe is rational numbers, maybe that universe is real numbers, whatever it is I'm talking about, where X is specifically not in S. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Any other X will do as long as it's within that relative universe. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
A couple of notes real quick now that we have terminology. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Of note that I can write this S T, I could write this as S intersected with T complement. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
You see that. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Everything in S that's not in T, that's the same thing <font color='red'>here, </font>this is everything in S that's also in T complement or that's also part of the set of things that are not in T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This is an equivalent idea. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We say that if S intersection T is equal to the null set. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In other words, if S and T have nothing in common, S and T are called disjoint. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
These are disjoint sets. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
For example, the set of all chairs and the set of all bowling balls are disjoint sets. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
There's no chair that's a bowling ball unless somebody's made one that I don't know about. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We call those disjoint. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
There are two sets that have no commonality, none of their elements are shared. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
I've gone over a lot of terminology. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Let's go ahead and do a quick example before I end this video and go onto the properties of these operations. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Let's just say my S is equal to one, two, three and my T is equal to two, four, five. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Given this, we can calculate out some of these things. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
My S intersection T, remember that's going to be all of the elements that are in both, S and T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That's going to be the set containing only the element two. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We see that one and three are not in T, so two is the only element that's in both, S and T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, remember the union is going to be all elements that are in S or T, so one, two, three, four, five. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This is why I keep saying this is like gluing these together. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This is the set of all elements that are just in one of these sets, and we take out any repetition. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Two is in both, but I'm not going to write two twice. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We know that, with sets in general, we don't include any repetition. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The difference S T, that's going to be equal to all of the elements in S that are not in T. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In other words, one and three. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The difference, T-S, that's going to be all the elements in T that are not in S, so four and five because they share that two. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Something you need to know, notice if I had this S T union with T-S, that's going to be the elements one, three, four, five. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That's the same thing as the union of S and T minus the intersection of S and T, isn't it? </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It's kind of interesting. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We call this an identity. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This is something that's an identity. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
In the next video, I'm going to go over a lot of our set operation rules, a lot of these identities so we can use these tools to simplify the same way that we would use an algebra to simplify an algebraic statement. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We can have these long strings of these set operations and we can use some of these rules in the next video to simplify these strings into something much more compact, much more simple. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Will see you there. </div>
