And another idea that a Big Bang also implies is if this is the furthest stuff out there, would this be the edge of the universe? Does the universe have an edge? And the answer to either of those questions, and that's what we're going to try to tackle in this, is that, one, the universe does not have an edge. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;And two, there is no outside space. We are not expanding into another space. And I'm going to explain that. Hopefully, we'll see why that is the case right now.

That's still an open question. But what I want to do is show you that it can have a finite volume and also have no edge. And most people believe-- and I want to say \ here because we can just go based on evidence and all that-- that we are talking about something with a finite volume, especially when you talk about the Big Bang theory.

That you would eventually get back to where you are. So let's go back to the question of an expanding universe, a expanding universe that's not expanding into any other space. That is all of the space, but it's still expanding. Well, this is the model. So you could imagine shortly after the Big Bang, our four-dimensional sphere looked like this. </p><figure>

Isn't that somehow part of the universe? And I would say if you're talking in three dimensions, no, it's not. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire universe is this surface. It is this surface of this four-dimensional sphere. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig14').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_009357_009387_group_008882_008883.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig14').src='line_figures_v2/obj_008146_009387_group.png'" >If you start talking about more dimensions, then, yes, you could talk about maybe things outside of our three-dimensional universe. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So as this expands in space/time-- so one way to view the fourth dimension is it is time itself-- things are just getting further and further apart. And I'll talk about more evidence in future videos for why the Big Bang is the best theory we have out there right now. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig14').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_009357_009387_group_009213_009387.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig14').src='line_figures_v2/obj_008146_009387_group.png'" >But as you could imagine, if you have two points on this sphere that are that far apart, as this sphere expands, this four-dimensional sphere, as this bubble blows up or this balloon blows up, those two points are just-- let me draw three points. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's say those are three points. </p><figure>

That if you go in any direction from any point in the universe, everything else is expanding away. And the further away you go, it looks like the faster it's expanding away from you. So I'll leave you there, something for you to kind of think about a little bit. And then we'll build on some of this to think about what it means to kind of observe the observable universe. </p>
