<tr><td>1.  Right now, the prevailing theory of how the universe came about is commonly called the Big Bang theory. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000074_000141_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>

<tr><td>2.  And really is just this idea that the universe started as kind of this infinitely small point, this infinitely small singularity. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000149_000182_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  And then it just had a big bang or it just expanded from that state to the universe that we know right now. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  And when I first imagined this-- and I think if it's also a byproduct of how it's named-- Big Bang, you kind of imagine this type of explosion, that everything was infinitely packed in together and then it exploded. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000460_000621_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  And then it exploded outward. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000627_000677_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  And then as all of the matter exploded outward, it started to condense. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  And then you have these little galaxies and super clusters of galaxies. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000735_000794_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  And they started to condense. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000806_000814_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  And then within them, planets condensed and stars condensed. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000825_000879_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  And then we have the type of universe that we have right now. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  But this model for visualizing the Big Bang has a couple of problems. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000964_000986_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  One is when we talk about the Big Bang, we're not talking about the matter, just the mass or just the matter in the universe being in one point. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000995_000998_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  We're talking about actual space expanding. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  So we're not just talking about something inside of space, like the physical mass, the physical matter expanding. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  We're talking about space itself. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  And so when you have this type of model, you have all of this stuff expanding. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  But you're like, whoa, look, isn't it expanding into something else? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  Maybe if the furthest out parts of this matter is right over here, what's this stuff over here? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001420_001494_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  And so you say, well, wouldn't that be space? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  So how can you say space itself is expanding? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  And another idea that a Big Bang also implies is if this is the furthest stuff out there, would this be the edge of the universe? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001705_001741_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  Does the universe have an edge? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001750_001759_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  And the answer to either of those questions, and that's what we're going to try to tackle in this, is that, one, the universe does not have an edge. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  And two, there is no outside space. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  We are not expanding into another space. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  And I'm going to explain that. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  Hopefully, we'll see why that is the case right now. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  So the best way to view it-- and we're going to view it by analogy. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  If I were tell you that I have a two-dimensional space that has a finite area, so it has a finite area-- so it's not infinite. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002134_002370_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  And it also has no edge. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  This once again, when you first look at it, seems difficult. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002423_002468_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  How do I just construct something that has a finite area, but still has no edge? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  Every time I try to draw an area, it looks like I have to have some edges. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  And then you might remember, what if that two-dimensional space is curved, what happens? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  And I think the easiest example of that is the surface of a sphere. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  Let me draw a sphere over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002796_002853_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  So this right here is a sphere. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  Let me draw some longitude and latitudinal lines on this sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002873_002951_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  On this sphere, all of a sudden-- and I'll shade it in a little bit, make it look nice-- this type of a sphere, you have a finite area. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002977_003029_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  You could imagine the surface of a balloon, or the surface of a bubble, or the surface of the Earth. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  You have a finite area, but you have no edge. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  If you keep going forever in one direction, you're going to go all the way around and come back to the other side. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003268_003344_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  Now, to imagine a three-dimensional space that has these same properties, a finite area and-- and I don't want to say finite area anymore, because we're not talking about a three-dimensional space. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  Let me draw it over here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  So let's think about a three-dimensional space, so a three-dimensional space. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003599_003709_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  Instead of area, since we're in three dimensions now, I want to talk about a finite volume and no edge. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003721_003926_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  How do I do that? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  And when you think about it superficially, well, look, if I have a finite volume, maybe it'll be contained in some type of a cube. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003969_004028_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  And then we clearly have edges in those situations. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  Or you could even think about a finite volume as being the inside of a sphere. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  And that clearly has an edge, this entire surface over there. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  So how do you construct a three-dimensional space that has a finite volume and no edge? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>53.  And that I'm going to tell you right now, it's very hard for us to visualize it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>54.  But in order to visualize it, I'm essentially going to draw the same thing as I drew right here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>55.  What you have to imagine, and you almost have to imagine it by analogy, unless you have some type of a profound brain wired for more than three spatial dimensions, is a sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004498_004563_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>56.  So let me make it clear. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004624_004636_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>57.  This is a two-dimensional surface. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004643_004760_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>58.  On the surface of the sphere, you can only move into directions, two perpendicular directions. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>59.  You could move like that or you could move like that. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004808_004877_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>60.  You could move left and right or you could move up and down. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>61.  So it's a two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004930_004984_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>62.  So if we take it by analogy, let's imagine, and it's hard to imagine, a three-dimensional surface. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005011_005045_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>63.  And you can do it mathematically. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005108_005224_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>64.  The math here is actually not that difficult. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>65.  It's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005298_005397_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>66.  And I'm going to draw it the same way. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005402_005449_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>67.  So if we kind of view those three dimensions are just these two dimensions of the surface, the same thing. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>68.  It's the same thing. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>69.  And if you imagine that-- I'm not saying that this is actually the shape of the universe. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>70.  We don't know the actual shape. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>71.  But we do know that it does have a slight curvature. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>72.  We don't know the actual shape, but a sphere is the simplest. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005654_005705_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>73.  There's other ones we could do. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>74.  A toroid would also fit the bill of having a finite volume with no edge. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>75.  And another thing, I want to make it clear, we actually don't even know whether it has just a finite volume. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>76.  That's still an open question. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>77.  But what I want to do is show you that it can have a finite volume and also have no edge. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>78.  And most people believe-- and I want to say \ here because we can just go based on evidence and all that-- that we are talking about something with a finite volume, especially when you talk about the Big Bang theory. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>79.  That kind of, on some dimension, implies a finite volume, although it could be a super large, unfathomably large volume, it is finite. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>80.  Now, if you have this, let's imagine this sphere. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>81.  Let's imagine this sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_006363_006400_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>82.  Once again, if you're on this surface of this four-dimensional sphere-- I obviously can not draw a four-dimensional sphere. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>83.  But if you're on the surface of this four-dimensional sphere, if you go in any direction, you'll come back out and come back to where you started. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_006573_006627_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>84.  If you go that way, you'll come back around here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_006642_006655_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>85.  Now, the universe is super huge. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_006671_006698_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>86.  So even light, maybe light itself will take an unbelievable amount of time to traverse it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>87.  And if this sphere itself is expanding, it might be expanding so fast that light might not ever be able to come back around it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>88.  But in theory, if something were fast enough, if something were to keep going around, it could eventually go back to this point. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>89.  Now, when we talk about a three-dimensional surface-- it's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere-- that means that any of the three dimensions-- over here, on the surface, I can only draw two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007056_007081_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>90.  But that means if this is true, if the universe is a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere, that means that if you go up and you just keep going up, you'll eventually come back from the bottom. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>91.  So if you keep going all the way up, you'll eventually come back to the point that you were. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007421_007471_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>92.  It might be an unbelievably large distance, but you'll eventually get back where you were. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>93.  If you go to the right, you'll eventually come back all the way around to the point where you were. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007553_007601_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>94.  And if you were to go into the page-- so if you were to go into the page-- let me draw it that way-- if you go into the page, you would eventually come back from above the page and come back to the point that you are. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007644_007769_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>95.  So that's what this implication would be. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>96.  That you would eventually get back to where you are. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>97.  So let's go back to the question of an expanding universe, a expanding universe that's not expanding into any other space. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>98.  That is all of the space, but it's still expanding. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>99.  Well, this is the model. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>100.  So you could imagine shortly after the Big Bang, our four-dimensional sphere looked like this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>101.  Maybe it was a little small four-dimensional sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008146_008176_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>102.  Maybe right at the Big Bang, it was like this little unbelievably small sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008203_008205_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>103.  Then a little bit later, it's this larger sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008259_008270_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>104.  Let me just shade it in to show you that it's kind of popping out of the page, that's it's a sphere. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008299_008335_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>105.  And then at a later time, the sphere might look like this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>106.  The sphere might look like this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008406_008455_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>107.  Now, your temptation might be to say, wait, Sal, isn't this stuff outside of this sphere, isn't that some type of a space that it's expanding into? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008468_008559_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>108.  Isn't that somehow part of the universe? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>109.  And I would say if you're talking in three dimensions, no, it's not. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>110.  The entire universe is this surface. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>111.  It is this surface of this four-dimensional sphere. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>112.  If you start talking about more dimensions, then, yes, you could talk about maybe things outside of our three-dimensional universe. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008882_008883_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>113.  So as this expands in space/time-- so one way to view the fourth dimension is it is time itself-- things are just getting further and further apart. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>114.  And I'll talk about more evidence in future videos for why the Big Bang is the best theory we have out there right now. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>115.  But as you could imagine, if you have two points on this sphere that are that far apart, as this sphere expands, this four-dimensional sphere, as this bubble blows up or this balloon blows up, those two points are just-- let me draw three points. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_009213_009387_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>116.  Let's say those are three points. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>117.  Those three points are just going to get further and further apart. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_009425_009445_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>118.  And that's actually one of the main points that-- or one of the first reasons why it made sense to believe the Big Bang-- is that everything is expanding, not from some central point. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_009459_009471_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>119.  But everything is expanding from everything. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>120.  That if you go in any direction from any point in the universe, everything else is expanding away. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>121.  And the further away you go, it looks like the faster it's expanding away from you. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>122.  So I'll leave you there, something for you to kind of think about a little bit. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>123.  And then we'll build on some of this to think about what it means to kind of observe the observable universe. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
