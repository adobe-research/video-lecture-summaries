<p>
 Right now, the prevailing theory of how the universe came about is commonly called the Big Bang theory.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000074_004009.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And really is just this idea that the universe started as kind of this infinitely small point, this infinitely small singularity.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then it just had a big bang or it just expanded from that state to the universe that we know right now.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And when I first imagined this-- and I think if it's also a byproduct of how it's named-- Big Bang, you kind of imagine this type of explosion, that everything was infinitely packed in together and then it exploded.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000582_007769.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then it exploded outward.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000627_007758.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then as all of the matter exploded outward, it started to condense.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then you have these little galaxies and super clusters of galaxies.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And they started to condense.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then within them, planets condensed and stars condensed.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we have the type of universe that we have right now.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But this model for visualizing the Big Bang has a couple of problems.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 One is when we talk about the Big Bang, we're not talking about the matter, just the mass or just the matter in the universe being in one point.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We're talking about actual space expanding.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So we're not just talking about something inside of space, like the physical mass, the physical matter expanding.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We're talking about space itself.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And so when you have this type of model, you have all of this stuff expanding.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But you're like, whoa, look, isn't it expanding into something else? Maybe if the furthest out parts of this matter is right over here, what's this stuff over here? And so you say, well, wouldn't that be space? So how can you say space itself is expanding? And another idea that a Big Bang also implies is if this is the furthest stuff out there, would this be the edge of the universe? Does the universe have an edge? And the answer to either of those questions, and that's what we're going to try to tackle in this, is that, one, the universe does not have an edge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And two, there is no outside space.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We are not expanding into another space.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And I'm going to explain that.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Hopefully, we'll see why that is the case right now.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the best way to view it-- and we're going to view it by analogy.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If I were tell you that I have a two-dimensional space that has a finite area, so it has a finite area-- so it's not infinite.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And it also has no edge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This once again, when you first look at it, seems difficult.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 How do I just construct something that has a finite area, but still has no edge? Every time I try to draw an area, it looks like I have to have some edges.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then you might remember, what if that two-dimensional space is curved, what happens? And I think the easiest example of that is the surface of a sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let me draw a sphere over here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this right here is a sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let me draw some longitude and latitudinal lines on this sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 On this sphere, all of a sudden-- and I'll shade it in a little bit, make it look nice-- this type of a sphere, you have a finite area.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You could imagine the surface of a balloon, or the surface of a bubble, or the surface of the Earth.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You have a finite area, but you have no edge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you keep going forever in one direction, you're going to go all the way around and come back to the other side.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, to imagine a three-dimensional space that has these same properties, a finite area and-- and I don't want to say finite area anymore, because we're not talking about a three-dimensional space.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let me draw it over here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's think about a three-dimensional space, so a three-dimensional space.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Instead of area, since we're in three dimensions now, I want to talk about a finite volume and no edge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 How do I do that? And when you think about it superficially, well, look, if I have a finite volume, maybe it'll be contained in some type of a cube.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we clearly have edges in those situations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Or you could even think about a finite volume as being the inside of a sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And that clearly has an edge, this entire surface over there.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So how do you construct a three-dimensional space that has a finite volume and no edge? And that I'm going to tell you right now, it's very hard for us to visualize it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But in order to visualize it, I'm essentially going to draw the same thing as I drew right here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 What you have to imagine, and you almost have to imagine it by analogy, unless you have some type of a profound brain wired for more than three spatial dimensions, is a sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let me make it clear.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is a two-dimensional surface.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 On the surface of the sphere, you can only move into directions, two perpendicular directions.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You could move like that or you could move like that.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You could move left and right or you could move up and down.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's a two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So if we take it by analogy, let's imagine, and it's hard to imagine, a three-dimensional surface.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And you can do it mathematically.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The math here is actually not that difficult.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And I'm going to draw it the same way.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So if we kind of view those three dimensions are just these two dimensions of the surface, the same thing.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's the same thing.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And if you imagine that-- I'm not saying that this is actually the shape of the universe.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We don't know the actual shape.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But we do know that it does have a slight curvature.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We don't know the actual shape, but a sphere is the simplest.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 There's other ones we could do.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 A toroid would also fit the bill of having a finite volume with no edge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And another thing, I want to make it clear, we actually don't even know whether it has just a finite volume.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That's still an open question.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But what I want to do is show you that it can have a finite volume and also have no edge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And most people believe-- and I want to say \ here because we can just go based on evidence and all that-- that we are talking about something with a finite volume, especially when you talk about the Big Bang theory.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That kind of, on some dimension, implies a finite volume, although it could be a super large, unfathomably large volume, it is finite.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, if you have this, let's imagine this sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's imagine this sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Once again, if you're on this surface of this four-dimensional sphere-- I obviously can not draw a four-dimensional sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But if you're on the surface of this four-dimensional sphere, if you go in any direction, you'll come back out and come back to where you started.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you go that way, you'll come back around here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, the universe is super huge.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So even light, maybe light itself will take an unbelievable amount of time to traverse it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And if this sphere itself is expanding, it might be expanding so fast that light might not ever be able to come back around it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But in theory, if something were fast enough, if something were to keep going around, it could eventually go back to this point.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, when we talk about a three-dimensional surface-- it's a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere-- that means that any of the three dimensions-- over here, on the surface, I can only draw two.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But that means if this is true, if the universe is a three-dimensional surface of a four-dimensional sphere, that means that if you go up and you just keep going up, you'll eventually come back from the bottom.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So if you keep going all the way up, you'll eventually come back to the point that you were.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It might be an unbelievably large distance, but you'll eventually get back where you were.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you go to the right, you'll eventually come back all the way around to the point where you were.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And if you were to go into the page-- so if you were to go into the page-- let me draw it that way-- if you go into the page, you would eventually come back from above the page and come back to the point that you are.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So that's what this implication would be.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That you would eventually get back to where you are.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's go back to the question of an expanding universe, a expanding universe that's not expanding into any other space.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That is all of the space, but it's still expanding.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Well, this is the model.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So you could imagine shortly after the Big Bang, our four-dimensional sphere looked like this.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Maybe it was a little small four-dimensional sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Maybe right at the Big Bang, it was like this little unbelievably small sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Then a little bit later, it's this larger sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let me just shade it in to show you that it's kind of popping out of the page, that's it's a sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then at a later time, the sphere might look like this.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The sphere might look like this.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, your temptation might be to say, wait, Sal, isn't this stuff outside of this sphere, isn't that some type of a space that it's expanding into? Isn't that somehow part of the universe? And I would say if you're talking in three dimensions, no, it's not.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The entire universe is this surface.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It is this surface of this four-dimensional sphere.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you start talking about more dimensions, then, yes, you could talk about maybe things outside of our three-dimensional universe.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So as this expands in space/time-- so one way to view the fourth dimension is it is time itself-- things are just getting further and further apart.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And I'll talk about more evidence in future videos for why the Big Bang is the best theory we have out there right now.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But as you could imagine, if you have two points on this sphere that are that far apart, as this sphere expands, this four-dimensional sphere, as this bubble blows up or this balloon blows up, those two points are just-- let me draw three points.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's say those are three points.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Those three points are just going to get further and further apart.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And that's actually one of the main points that-- or one of the first reasons why it made sense to believe the Big Bang-- is that everything is expanding, not from some central point.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But everything is expanding from everything.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That if you go in any direction from any point in the universe, everything else is expanding away.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And the further away you go, it looks like the faster it's expanding away from you.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So I'll leave you there, something for you to kind of think about a little bit.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we'll build on some of this to think about what it means to kind of observe the observable universe.
</p>
</div>
