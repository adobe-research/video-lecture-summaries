<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We've already explored a two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If I have some region-- so this is my region right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc1_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We'll call it R. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And let's call the boundary of my region, let's call that C. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And if I have some vector field in this region, so let me draw a vector field like this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If I draw a vector field just like that, our two-dimensional divergence theorem, which we really derived from Green's theorem, told us that the flux across our boundary of this region-- so let me write that out. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The flux across the boundary, so the flux is essentially going to be the vector field. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's going to be our vector field F dotted with the normal outward-facing vector. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the normal vector at any point is this outward-facing vector, So our vector field, dotted with the normal-facing vector at our boundary times our little chunk of the boundary. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If we were to sum them all up over the entire boundary-- let me write that a little bit neater-- that's the same thing as summing up over the entire region. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's sum up over the entire region. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So summing up over this entire region, each little chunk of area, dA-- we could call that dx dy if we wanted to if we're dealing in the xy domain right over <font color='red'>here, </font>but each little chunk of area times the divergence of F, which is really saying, how much is that vector field pulling apart? 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc11_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's times the divergence of F. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And hopefully, it made intuitive sense. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The way that I drew this vector field right over <font color='red'>here, </font>you see everything's kind of coming out. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc14_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You could almost call this a source right <font color='red'>here, </font>where the vector field seems like it's popping out of there. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc15_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This has positive divergence right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc16_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And so because of this, you actually see that the vector field at the boundary is actually going in the direction of the normal vector, pretty close to the direction of the normal vector, so it makes sense. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You have positive divergence, and this is going to be a positive value. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The vector field is going, for the most part, in the direction of the normal vector. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the larger this is, the larger that is. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So hopefully, some intuitive sense. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you had another vector field-- so let me draw another region-- that looked like this, so I could draw a couple situations. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So one where there's very limited divergence, maybe it's just a constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The vector field doesn't really change as you go in any given direction. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Over <font color='red'>here </font>you'll get positive fluxes. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc25_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I don't know what the plural of flux is. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You'll get positive fluxes, because the vector field seems to be going in roughly the same direction as our normal vector. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But <font color='red'>here, </font>you'll get a negative flux. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc28_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So stuff is coming in <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc29_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you imagine your vector field is essentially some type of mass density times volume, and we've thought about that before, this is showing how much stuff is coming in, and then stuff is coming out. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So your net flux will be close to zero. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Stuff is coming in, and stuff is coming out. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Here, you're just saying, hey, stuff is constantly coming out of this surface. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So hopefully, this gives you a sense that <font color='red'>here </font>you have very low divergence, and you would have a low flux, total aggregate flux, going through your boundary. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc34_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
<font color='red'>Here </font>you have a high divergence, and you would have a high aggregate flux. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc35_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I could draw another situation. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is my region R. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And let's say that we have negative divergence, or we could even call it convergence. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Convergence isn't an actual technical term, but you could imagine if the vector field is converging within R, well, the divergence is going to be negative in this situation. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's actually converging, which is the opposite of diverging. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the divergence is negative in this situation. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And also the flux across the boundary is going to be negative. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Because as we see <font color='red'>here, </font>the way I drew it, across most of this boundary, the vector field is going in the opposite direction. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc43_word0.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's going in the opposite direction as our normal vector at any point. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So hopefully, this gives you a sense of why there's this connection between the divergence over the region and the flux across the boundary. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, now we're just going to extend this to three dimensions, and it's the exact same reasoning. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If we have a-- and I'll define it a little bit more precisely in future videos-- a simple, solid region. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let me just draw it. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And I'm going to try to draw it in three dimensions. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's say it looks something like that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And one way to think about it is this is going to be a region that doesn't bend back on itself. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And if you have a region that bends back on itself-- well, we'll think about it in multiple ways. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But out of all the volumes of three dimensions that you can imagine, these are the ones that don't bend back on themselves. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And there are some that you might not be able to imagine that would also not make the case. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But even if you had ones that bent back on themselves, you could separate them out into other ones that don't. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So <font color='red'>here </font>is just a simple solid region over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc56_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<img src= "locate_word/stc56_word1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I'll make it look three dimensional. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So maybe if it was transparent, you would see it like that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then you see the front of it like that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's this kind of elliptical, circular, blob-looking thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So that could be the back of it. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then if you go to the front, it could look something like that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is our simple solid region. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I'll call it-- well, I'll call it R still. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But we're dealing with a three dimensional. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We are now dealing with a three-dimensional region. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now the boundary of this is no longer a line. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We're now in three dimensions. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The boundary is a surface. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So I'll call that S. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
S is the boundary of R. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now let's throw on a vector field <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc72_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now, this is a vector field in three dimensions. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now let's imagine that we actually have positive divergence of our vector field within this region right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc74_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we have positive divergence. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So you can imagine that it's kind of-- the vector field within the region, it's a source of the vector field, or the vector field is diverging out. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
That's just the case I drew right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc77_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And the other thing we want to say about vector field S, it's oriented in a way that its normal vector is outward facing, so outward normal vector. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the normal, it's oriented so that the surface-- the normal vector is like that. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The other option is that you have an inward-facing normal vector. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But we're assuming it's an outward-facing N. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, then we just extrapolate this to three dimensions. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We essentially say the flux across the surface. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the flux across the surface, you would take your vector field, dot it with the normal vector at the surface, and then multiply that times a little chunk of surface, so multiply that times a little chunk of surface, and then sum it up along the whole surface, so sum it up. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's going to be a surface integral. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is flux across the surface. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's going to be equal to-- if we were to sum up the divergence, if we were to sum up across the whole volume, so now if we're summing up things on every little chunk of volume over <font color='red'>here </font>in three dimensions, we're going to have to take integrals along each dimension. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc87_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's going to be a triple integral over the region of the divergence of F. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we're going to say, how much is F? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
What is the divergence at F at each point? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then multiply it times the volume of that little chunk to sense of how much is it totally diverging in that volume. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then you sum it up. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
That should be equal to the flux. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's completely analogous to what's <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc94_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
<font color='red'>Here </font>we had a flux across the line. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc95_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We had essentially a two-dimensional-- or I guess we could say it's a one-dimensional boundary, so flux across the curve. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And <font color='red'>here </font>we have the flux across a surface. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc97_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
<font color='red'>Here </font>we were summing the divergence in the region. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc98_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
<font color='red'>Here </font>we're summing it in the volume. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc99_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But it's the exact same logic. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you had a vector field like this that was fairly constant going through the surface, on one side you would have a negative flux. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
On the other side, you would have a positive flux, and they would roughly cancel out. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And that makes sense, because there would be no diverging going on. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you had a converging vector field, where it's coming in, the flux would be negative, because it's going in the opposite direction of the normal vector. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And so the divergence would be negative as well, because essentially the vector field would be converging. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So hopefully this gives you an intuition of what the divergence theorem is actually saying something very, very, very, very-- almost common sense or intuitive. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now in the next few videos, we can do some worked examples, just so you feel comfortable computing or manipulating these integrals. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we'll do a couple of proof videos, where we actually prove the divergence theorem. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
