</br>
<object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(330)">I'll call it-- well, I'll call it R still. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(333)">But we're dealing with a three dimensional. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(335)">We are now dealing with a three-dimensional region. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(340)">And now the boundary of this is no longer a line. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(343)">We're now in three dimensions. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(344)">The boundary is a surface. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(346)">So I'll call that S. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(350)">S is the boundary of R. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(357)">And now let's throw on a vector field here. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(359)">Now, this is a vector field in three dimensions. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(361)">And now let's imagine that we actually have positive divergence of our vector field within this region right over here. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(368)">So we have positive divergence. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(369)">So you can imagine that it's kind of-- the vector field within the region, it's a source of the vector field, or the vector field is diverging out. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(381)">That's just the case I drew right over here. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(383)">And the other thing we want to say about vector field S, it's oriented in a way that its normal vector is outward facing, so outward normal vector. </object></br>

</br>
<object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(393)">So the normal, it's oriented so that the surface-- the normal vector is like that. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(398)">The other option is that you have an inward-facing normal vector. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(401)">But we're assuming it's an outward-facing N. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(403)">Well, then we just extrapolate this to three dimensions. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(406)">We essentially say the flux across the surface. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(409)">So the flux across the surface, you would take your vector field, dot it with the normal vector at the surface, and then multiply that times a little chunk of surface, so multiply that times a little chunk of surface, and then sum it up along the whole surface, so sum it up. </object></br>
<img src= "subline_linebreak_test/line3_upto_sub0_subsub3.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</br>
<object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(431)">So it's going to be a surface integral. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(434)">So this is flux across the surface. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(441)">It's going to be equal to-- if we were to sum up the divergence, if we were to sum up across the whole volume, so now if we're summing up things on every little chunk of volume over here in three dimensions, we're going to have to take integrals along each dimension. </object></br>
<img src= "subline_linebreak_test/line3_upto_sub0_subsub4.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</br>
<object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(458)">So it's going to be a triple integral over the region of the divergence of F. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(467)">So we're going to say, how much is F? </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(469)">What is the divergence at F at each point? </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(471)">And then multiply it times the volume of that little chunk to sense of how much is it totally diverging in that volume. </object></div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
<p><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(481)">And then you sum it up. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(482)">That should be equal to the flux. </object><object id="textlink" onclick="playvideo_at(483)">It's completely analogous to what's here. </object></p></div>
