0:00We've already explored a two-dimensional version
0:02of the divergence theorem.
0:03If I have some region-- so this is my region right over here.
0:09We'll call it R. And let's call the boundary of my region,
0:13let's call that C. And if I have some vector
0:16field in this region, so let me draw a vector field like this.
0:20If I draw a vector field just like that,
0:26our two-dimensional divergence theorem,
0:28which we really derived from Green's theorem,
0:31told us that the flux across our boundary of this region--
0:37so let me write that out.
0:38The flux across the boundary, so the flux
0:41is essentially going to be the vector field.
0:43It's going to be our vector field F
0:46dotted with the normal outward-facing vector.
0:50So the normal vector at any point
0:52is this outward-facing vector, So our vector field,
0:55dotted with the normal-facing vector at our boundary times
0:59our little chunk of the boundary.
1:01
1:06If we were to sum them all up over the entire boundary--
1:10let me write that a little bit neater--
1:15that's the same thing as summing up over the entire region.
1:19So let's sum up over the entire region.
1:21So summing up over this entire region, each little chunk
1:25of area, dA-- we could call that dx dy if we wanted to
1:31if we're dealing in the xy domain
1:33right over here, but each little chunk of area times
1:36the divergence of F, which is really saying,
1:38how much is that vector field pulling apart?
1:42So it's times the divergence of F.
1:47And hopefully, it made intuitive sense.
1:49The way that I drew this vector field right over here,
1:51you see everything's kind of coming out.
1:53You could almost call this a source right here,
1:55where the vector field seems like it's popping out of there.
1:57This has positive divergence right over here.
2:00And so because of this, you actually
2:02see that the vector field at the boundary
2:05is actually going in the direction of the normal vector,
2:07pretty close to the direction of the normal vector,
2:09so it makes sense.
2:10You have positive divergence, and this
2:12is going to be a positive value.
2:14The vector field is going, for the most part,
2:15in the direction of the normal vector.
2:17So the larger this is, the larger that is.
2:20So hopefully, some intuitive sense.
2:21If you had another vector field-- so
2:26let me draw another region-- that looked like this, so
2:29I could draw a couple situations.
2:31So one where there's very limited divergence,
2:33maybe it's just a constant.
2:35The vector field doesn't really change
2:37as you go in any given direction.
2:41Over here you'll get positive fluxes.
2:45I don't know what the plural of flux is.
2:47You'll get positive fluxes, because the vector field seems
2:50to be going in roughly the same direction as our normal vector.
2:53But here, you'll get a negative flux.
2:55So stuff is coming in here.
2:57If you imagine your vector field is essentially
2:59some type of mass density times volume,
3:01and we've thought about that before,
3:03this is showing how much stuff is coming in,
3:05and then stuff is coming out.
3:07So your net flux will be close to zero.
3:11Stuff is coming in, and stuff is coming out.
3:13Here, you're just saying, hey, stuff
3:15is constantly coming out of this surface.
3:18So hopefully, this gives you a sense
3:19that here you have very low divergence,
3:21and you would have a low flux, total aggregate flux,
3:26going through your boundary.
3:27Here you have a high divergence, and you
3:28would have a high aggregate flux.
3:30I could draw another situation.
3:33So this is my region R. And let's say
3:36that we have negative divergence,
3:38or we could even call it convergence.
3:39Convergence isn't an actual technical term,
3:41but you could imagine if the vector field is converging
3:46within R, well, the divergence is
3:49going to be negative in this situation.
3:51It's actually converging, which is the opposite of diverging.
3:53So the divergence is negative in this situation.
3:57And also the flux across the boundary
3:59is going to be negative.
4:00Because as we see here, the way I
4:02drew it, across most of this boundary,
4:04the vector field is going in the opposite direction.
4:06It's going in the opposite direction as our normal vector
4:10at any point.
4:11So hopefully, this gives you a sense
4:12of why there's this connection between the divergence
4:15over the region and the flux across the boundary.
4:19Well, now we're just going to extend this
4:21to three dimensions, and it's the exact same reasoning.
4:24If we have a-- and I'll define it a little bit more
4:26precisely in future videos-- a simple, solid region.
4:31So let me just draw it.
4:32And I'm going to try to draw it in three dimensions.
4:35So let's say it looks something like that.
4:39And one way to think about it is this
4:40is going to be a region that doesn't bend back on itself.
4:43And if you have a region that bends back on itself-- well,
4:46we'll think about it in multiple ways.
4:47But out of all the volumes of three dimensions
4:49that you can imagine, these are the ones
4:51that don't bend back on themselves.
4:53And there are some that you might not
4:55be able to imagine that would also not make the case.
4:57But even if you had ones that bent back on themselves,
5:02you could separate them out into other ones that don't.
5:05So here is just a simple solid region over here.
5:08I'll make it look three dimensional.
5:10So maybe if it was transparent, you would see it like that.
5:13And then you see the front of it like that.
5:16So it's this kind of elliptical, circular, blob-looking thing.
5:20So that could be the back of it.
5:22And then if you go to the front, it
5:24could look something like that.
5:26So this is our simple solid region.
5:30I'll call it-- well, I'll call it R still.
5:33But we're dealing with a three dimensional.
5:35We are now dealing with a three-dimensional region.
5:40And now the boundary of this is no longer a line.
5:43We're now in three dimensions.
5:44The boundary is a surface.
5:46So I'll call that S. S is the boundary of R.
5:57And now let's throw on a vector field here.
5:59Now, this is a vector field in three dimensions.
6:01And now let's imagine that we actually
6:02have positive divergence of our vector field
6:06within this region right over here.
6:08So we have positive divergence.
6:09So you can imagine that it's kind of-- the vector
6:12field within the region, it's a source of the vector field,
6:16or the vector field is diverging out.
6:18
6:21That's just the case I drew right over here.
6:23And the other thing we want to say about vector field
6:25S, it's oriented in a way that its normal vector is outward
6:28facing, so outward normal vector.
6:33So the normal, it's oriented so that the surface--
6:36the normal vector is like that.
6:38The other option is that you have
6:39an inward-facing normal vector.
6:41But we're assuming it's an outward-facing N. Well,
6:43then we just extrapolate this to three dimensions.
6:46We essentially say the flux across the surface.
6:49So the flux across the surface, you would take your vector
6:52field, dot it with the normal vector at the surface,
7:01and then multiply that times a little chunk of surface,
7:04so multiply that times a little chunk of surface,
7:07and then sum it up along the whole surface, so sum it up.
7:11So it's going to be a surface integral.
7:12So this is flux across the surface.
7:14
7:21It's going to be equal to-- if we were to sum up
7:26the divergence, if we were to sum up across the whole volume,
7:31so now if we're summing up things
7:32on every little chunk of volume over here in three dimensions,
7:36we're going to have to take integrals along each dimension.
7:38So it's going to be a triple integral
7:43over the region of the divergence of F.
7:47So we're going to say, how much is F?
7:49What is the divergence at F at each point?
7:51And then multiply it times the volume of that little chunk
7:56to sense of how much is it totally diverging
7:59in that volume.
8:01And then you sum it up.
8:02That should be equal to the flux.
8:03It's completely analogous to what's here.
8:05Here we had a flux across the line.
8:08We had essentially a two-dimensional--
8:10or I guess we could say it's a one-dimensional boundary,
8:12so flux across the curve.
8:18And here we have the flux across a surface.
8:20Here we were summing the divergence in the region.
8:23Here we're summing it in the volume.
8:24But it's the exact same logic.
8:26If you had a vector field like this
8:27that was fairly constant going through the surface,
8:30on one side you would have a negative flux.
8:32On the other side, you would have a positive flux,
8:33and they would roughly cancel out.
8:35And that makes sense, because there
8:36would be no diverging going on.
8:38If you had a converging vector field, where it's coming in,
8:40the flux would be negative, because it's
8:42going in the opposite direction of the normal vector.
8:45And so the divergence would be negative as well,
8:48because essentially the vector field would be converging.
8:51So hopefully this gives you an intuition
8:53of what the divergence theorem is actually saying something
8:57very, very, very, very-- almost common sense or intuitive.
9:01And now in the next few videos, we
9:02can do some worked examples, just so you
9:04feel comfortable computing or manipulating these integrals.
9:07And then we'll do a couple of proof videos, where we actually
9:10prove the divergence theorem.
