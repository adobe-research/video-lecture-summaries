<p>Let us discuss about another way of solving a quadratic equation. </p><figure>

<p>That is, by completing the square, completing the square method. In the previous videos, we have covered factorization method. Now I'll tell you the algorithm that is used in completing the square method. </p><figure>

<p>Let us apply the completing the square method to the standard form of quadratic equation. </p><figure>

</figure>
<p>The first step of completing the square method is to make the coefficient of X squared equal to one. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_000354_000743_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig3" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 2(b) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What we do is we divide by the coefficient of X squared on both sides so that the coefficient of X squared becomes one. Let's do it, and then you will understand. </p><figure>

<p>Dividing the equation by A. </p><figure>

<figcaption> Figure 4(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>What do we get? AX squared by A plus BX by A plus C by A is equal to zero by A. That is nothing but zero. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_001241_001433_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig6" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 5(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The coefficient of X squared here has become one. That was our purpose of doing this step. B by AX plus C by A is equal to zero. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_001466_001861_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig7" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 6(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the second step what we need to do is we will add and subtract half of the coefficient of X, square of half of coefficient of X. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_001887_002050_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig8" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 7(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That is B by two A. It is half of B by A squared. We need to add and subtract this thing in this equation. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_002169_002465_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig9" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 8(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>X squared plus B by AX plus B by two A squared. If we add something to an equation, we need to subtract the same amount to keep the equation intact. Plus C by A is equal to zero. I haven't made any changes to the original equation. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_002554_002703_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig10" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 9(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I've just added something and subtracted the same thing. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_002755_002815_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig11" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 10(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, if you notice carefully, this expression has become of the form A squared plus B squared plus two AB. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_002888_002933_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig12" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 11(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We can write it as A plus B whole squared. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_002967_003223_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig13" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 12(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This expression can be written as X plus B by two A whole squared, and the rest of the expression, B by two A whole squared plus C by A is equal to zero. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_003265_003281_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig14" class="">

<p></p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_003305_003517_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig15" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 14(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We will keep this complete square on the left hand side, and let us take the rest of the things to the right hand side of the equation. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_003563_003774_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig16" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 15(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now, let us further solve this equation. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_003793_003911_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig17" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 16(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This will become B squared by four A squared minus C by A, and this will become B squared minus four AC divided by four A squared. Let me take another page, then I'll explain. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_004067_004316_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig18" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 17(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>X plus B by two A whole squared is equal to B squared minus four AC is equal to B squared minus four AC divided by four A squared. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_003793_004405_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig19" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 16(b) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>B squared minus four AC divided by four A squared. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_004515_004614_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig20" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 18(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Next logical step would be to take the square root. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_004627_004880_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig21" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 19(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I'll get X plus B by two A is equal to plus/minus and the root B squared minus four AC divided by two A. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_004994_005333_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig22" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 20(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The entire purpose of this exercise is to get the values of X, so we'll keep X on the left hand side and take this B by two A to the right hand side. We'll change the sign. Minus B by two A plus/minus B squared minus four AC divided by two A. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_005340_005489_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig23" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 21(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Here we got the values of X, so we can further simplify it. Minus B plus/minus B squared minus four AC divided by two A. </p><figure>
<img src= "line_figures/obj_005526_005533_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="fig24" class="">
<figcaption> Figure 22(a) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These are the values of X that we get by completing the square method. </p><figure>

<figcaption> Figure 21(b) </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We'll further discuss various terms in this expression, but this is how we do solutions of quadratic equations using completing the square method. I'll take some examples to further simplify it in further videos. </p>
