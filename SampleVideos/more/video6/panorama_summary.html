Let us discuss about another way of solving a quadratic equation. 
</p><p>
That is, by completing the square, completing the square method. 
</p><p>
In the previous videos, we have covered factorization method. 
</p><p>
Now I'll tell you the algorithm that is used in completing the square method. 
</p><p>
Let us apply the completing the square method to the standard form of quadratic equation. 
</p><p>
The first step of completing the square method is to make the coefficient of X squared equal to one. 
</p><p>
What we do is we divide by the coefficient of X squared on both sides so that the coefficient of X squared becomes one. 
</p><p>
Let's do it, and then you will understand. 
</p><p>
Dividing the equation by A. 
</p><p>
What do we get? AX squared by A plus BX by A plus C by A is equal to zero by A. 
</p><p>
That is nothing but zero. 
</p><p>
The coefficient of X squared here has become one. 
</p><p>
That was our purpose of doing this step. 
</p><p>
B by AX plus C by A is equal to zero. 
</p><p>
In the second step what we need to do is we will add and subtract half of the coefficient of X, square of half of coefficient of X. 
</p><p>
That is B by two A. 
</p><p>
It is half of B by A squared. 
</p><p>
We need to add and subtract this thing in this equation. 
</p><p>
X squared plus B by AX plus B by two A squared. 
</p><p>
If we add something to an equation, we need to subtract the same amount to keep the equation intact. 
</p><p>
Plus C by A is equal to zero. 
</p><p>
I haven't made any changes to the original equation. 
</p><p>
I've just added something and subtracted the same thing. 
</p><p>
Now, if you notice carefully, this expression has become of the form A squared plus B squared plus two AB. 
</p><p>
We can write it as A plus B whole squared. 
</p><p>
This expression can be written as X plus B by two A whole squared, and the rest of the expression, B by two A whole squared plus C by A is equal to zero. 
</p><p>
We will keep this complete square on the left hand side, and let us take the rest of the things to the right hand side of the equation. 
</p><p>
Now, let us further solve this equation. 
</p><p>
This will become B squared by four A squared minus C by A, and this will become B squared minus four AC divided by four A squared. 
</p><p>
Let me take another page, then I'll explain. 
</p><p>
X plus B by two A whole squared is equal to B squared minus four AC is equal to B squared minus four AC divided by four A squared. 
</p><p>
B squared minus four AC divided by four A squared. 
</p><p>
Next logical step would be to take the square root. 
</p><p>
I'll get X plus B by two A is equal to plus/minus and the root B squared minus four AC divided by two A. 
</p><p>
The entire purpose of this exercise is to get the values of X, so we'll keep X on the left hand side and take this B by two A to the right hand side. 
</p><p>
We'll change the sign. 
</p><p>
Minus B by two A plus/minus B squared minus four AC divided by two A. 
</p><p>
Here we got the values of X, so we can further simplify it. 
</p><p>
Minus B plus/minus B squared minus four AC divided by two A. 
</p><p>
These are the values of X that we get by completing the square method. 
</p><p>
We'll further discuss various terms in this expression, but this is how we do solutions of quadratic equations using completing the square method. 
</p><p>
I'll take some examples to further simplify it in further videos.
