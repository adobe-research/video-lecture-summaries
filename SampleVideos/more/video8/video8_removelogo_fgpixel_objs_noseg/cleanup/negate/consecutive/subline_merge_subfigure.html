<h1>Conditional Probability 1 </h1><br>

</div>
<div id="line0_sub0_c2" class="c2", width="">
</div>
</div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Conditional probability is involved with the multiplication rule. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The notation for conditional probability is the probability of B given A. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So this is it. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
A straight up-and-down line. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So as I said it's the probability of event b given a has occurred. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Okay. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
What's the probability B happening given that we already know that A has occurred. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now probability involves a condition called independence. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Two events are independent if the occurrence one does not affect the probability of the occurrence of the other. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Thus they would be independent. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So, when we think of the example we saw with the balls and the urn and we were selecting two balls from the urn one at a time. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Once we drew the first ball out if we put it back in then the probability on our next draw is not affected by the first withdrawal from the urn because it were back to the beginning. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The urn is just as it was before the first draw if you replace that first ball. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So they would be independent. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
However as we saw with our example with the urn if you do not put the ball back in the urn then there is a change in the probability. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It is affected on the second draw by the fact that you have gotten the first. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So what i'm saying is in when a procedure is with replacement we have independent events. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
If the procedure appears without replacement we say we have dependent events. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So our multiplication rule is written. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The probability remember this is A and B. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The word and indicates multiplication rule. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Is equal to the probability of a thats our first draw. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Right. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Times the probability of b given a has already occurred. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So if they're independent the probability of B given A is occurred is the same thing as the probability of B. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
If they are dependent events then we do make an adjustment for this condition. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So returning to that example we had of the urn. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And we had we wanted the probability of red and white. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
We would say well that's the probability that the first one is red times the probability that the second one was White given that the first one was red. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And remember when our situation was dependent events, what we saw was there were three Reds. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So the probability of red was three Reds out of 12 balls in the urn times the probability of white. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Well they're still five white balls in the urn but now what has changed is that there is only 11 balls total in the urn. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So that's the probability of B given that a has already occurred. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
When a occurred one of these balls was taken out and set aside. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And that's where we get any answer point 1 1 3 6. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
okay. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This was our case I think we called it well I don't think we labeled them. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
But that was the second case where we just mentioned that it was without replacement. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now with replacement again if they are if events are independent. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Then our multiplication rule is the probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Only if they're independent events because be has not been effective by A. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
This works for both cuz you'll take that into consideration. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
But I'll make a note <font color='red'>here </font>that this is specifically use for dependent events. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
okay. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
are without replacement. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So let's summarize what were saying <font color='red'>here </font>about independence. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Just call this a independece summary. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Okay. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So these statements are equivalent. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
These statements I am about to write. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
First A and B are independent events. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Or if that's true that's the same thing as saying the probability of A and B is equal to the probability of A times the probability of B. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That's the same thing as saying they are independent events. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Well why can we say that? </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Well because the probability of A given B is the same thing as the probability of A. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And the probability of B given A is the same thing is the probability of B. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
okay. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Don't miss these up. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
It does matter what order those are in. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The probability that a occurs given that be has already occurred or the probability B occurs given that A has already occurred. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And you can see how they and found are written based on independent events. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
That's what we're saying. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Recall that's what we were saying previously that if they are independent events the probability that A given B is the same thing as probability of A. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
If they are independent events the probability b given a is the same thing as the probability of B. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So that's our case with me return the ball to the urn after that first draw so it makes no difference it's not changing the outcome out for the probability of being occurring so these events would be independent. </div>
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
there's no condition of dependence there. </div>
