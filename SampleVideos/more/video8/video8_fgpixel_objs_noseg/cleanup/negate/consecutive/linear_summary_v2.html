Once we drew the first ball out if we put it back in then the probability on our next draw is not affected by the first withdrawal from the be urn because it were back to the beginning. The urn is just as it was before the first draw if you replace that first ball. So they would be independent. However as we saw with our example with the urn if you do not put the ball back in the urn then there is a change in the probability. It is affected on the second draw by the fact that you have gotten the first. </p><figure>

It does matter what order those are in. the probability that a occurs given that be has already occurred or the probability B occurs given that A has already occurred. And you can see how they and found are written based on independent events. That's what we're saying. Recall that's what we were saying previously that if they are independent events the probability that A given B is the same thing as probability of A. If they are independent events the probability b given a is the same thing as the probability of B. So that's our case with me return the ball to the urn after that first draw so it makes no difference it's not changing the outcome out for the probability of being occurring so these events would be independent. there's no condition of dependence there. </p>
