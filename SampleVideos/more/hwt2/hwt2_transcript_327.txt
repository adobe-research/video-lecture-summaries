0:04hi in this video I'm going to discuss
0:07the anatomy of the eye so to illustrate
0:11with I'm gonna draw the eye in cross-section splitting it down here
0:16and al point up you will be from here so let me just great quickly
0:34the icon to look like this and I'll stop by labeling some
0:38the major features the anterior chamber
0:42is this space at the front of the eye here
0:45and just behind it we have the post Area Chamber
0:51these two chambers filled with a fluid
0:55called the acquiesce humor the anterior and posterior chambers
1:01separated by the onerous which is the colored part of the eye
1:06the lens then sits in behind the iris
1:10and palm the post jury award
1:13the post Area Chamber
1:18behind the lens life a large space called the peak reached
1:22chamber
1:23which is filled with the tool at Northampton's called the Beatrice Yuma
1:27not to be confused with the ok with you man
1:30in the anterior and posted chambers holding the lens in place
1:37we have tiny ciliary muscle which
1:40touched zone newell's small fibrous strand connective tissue
1:44that attach to the lens
1:47by contracting and relaxing the ciliary muscles
1:51and zone UAL's change the shape lanes
1:54to help me i focus
1:57at the back the I we have a small hit called
2:00will be a which is an area with a high density
2:03up color photoreceptors called
2:07homes
2:08this is the part retin-a used to high security prison
2:14at the back in the eyeball we also have the optic disc
2:17this is the point almond from the potala receptors
2:21dive back through the retina and then on wood
2:24to the brain through the optic nerve
2:27the optic disc is responsible for the Blind Spot
2:30in ambition
2:33of course I should also labeled this whole section as the retina
2:36which is the party I responsible sensing lot
2:40out here
2:43we have the sclera which is the white part of the eye
2:47and that the front we have the cornea which is
2:50the Cleopatra the I at the back
2:54this is the optic nerve extending back toward the brain
2:58and on with you we can also see to
3:026 muscles responsible I movements II
3:07the superior rectus muscle and the inferior rectus muscle
3:11and that's an overview
