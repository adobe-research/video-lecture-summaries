For example, let us say I am having x minus one into x minus two. What would be the usual process for this? First of all, I would multiply this x into this x to get x two and I will mention the equal to sign. </div>

Later, the next step, x two remains as it is. minus two x and minus x makes minus three x, plus two. </div>

<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The process is really easy, and we could do it in a fairly simple way. But here, there are only two factors that have to be multiplied, so that we could follow this process. </div>
</div>
<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "linegroups/sublines/line000000_000004.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

But what if we had some three or four factors to multiply? Let us say I have one more over here, like say x minus three. </div>

<img src= "linegroups/sublines/line000001_000004.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
What I will have to do is, I will have to put a bracket over here, and I will have to continue multiplying these corresponding things, which actually means that I will have to reach through the step, and then I will have to perform similar operations with these two. </div>

<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, here there were only two terms in one bracket and another two terms in another bracket. Here we are having three terms in the first bracket, and two terms in the latter. You will see that, as we move down, as the number of factors increases, the number of terms that has to be multiplied also goes up. This makes things really complicated. There is an easy way to avoid this hassle. Let us see how. Here, let us generalize this entire process first. We will first derive our results and then see how this pattern actually works. </div>
</div>
<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "linegroups/sublines/line000003_000000.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
First of all, your first factor is in the form of ax plus b, and another is in the form of cx plus d, and a third one is in the form of ex plus f. But these three factors, we can derive our results, and we can expand this method, even if you are having say four or five factors, or even any number of factors. </div>
</div>
<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">

<img src= "linegroups/sublines/line000005_000000.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
So, ax into cx is equal to acx two and ax into d is adx, plus b into cx is bcx, plus b into d. This forms first bracket, and multiply it by ex plus f. Fine. Now, simplifying this further, I will get acx two plus, taking x common, ad plus bc plus bd. </div>

I will stop over here, and this is a really quick way to obtain the simplified form of multiplication of two factors. </div>

Let's say I have two x plus one into five x plus three. </div>
</div>
<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Rather than multiplying things correspondingly, what I can do is, a into c. Let's look at this. </div>
</div>

<img src= "linegroups/sublines/line000003_000001.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

<div id="c2" class="", width="">
What is a into c? It is a coefficient of x, and c is also a coefficient of x. </div>
</div>
<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
What we want is x two. </div>
</div>
<div id="wrapper" class="", width="">

<img src= "linegroups/sublines/line000008_000001.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
In this general form, you can see that when we are multiplying two factors, both of them having x, the highest power will be x two. </div>

<div id="c2" class="", width="">
In this general form, you can see that when we are multiplying two factors, both of them having x, the highest power will be x two. What would be its coefficient? Multiplying its corresponding coefficients of five into two is ten. Fine, ten plus next lower power would be x. Now, you can update x, ad plus bc. What is a into this term, plus b into this term? A is a coefficient of x, multiplied by its constant part that is the part that does not have variable along with it of the second bracket, plus the constant part of the first bracket, multiplied by the part which is the coefficient of the variable in the second bracket. Take the coefficient of x, that is a, into d. Let's apply it over here. Coefficient of x is two multiplied by three, so you get six. </div>

Let us do it with our usual method, two x plus one multiplied by five x plus three, the ten x two plus six x plus five x plus three, which is equal to ten x two plus six plus five is eleven x, plus this is a plus sign plus three. </div>

You're getting both same answer, but this method is really efficient. Now, you might be wondering if every time you have to write this general form. You really don't need to.

Here there are two factors, so highest power will be squared, and there will be some coefficient of it. It will be five into three, fifteen. Then, next power will be x. What will be its coefficient? five that is coefficient of x in the first bracket, and the constant part in the second is five into two is ten. Then, constant part of first bracket, multiplied by the coefficient of x in second, it is minus three because here it's minus one. Put addition sign over here. Plus... now you have to multiply the two constant parts, minus one into two. That is minus two so what we get is one five x two ten minus three seven x, minus two. </div>

What if we have one more term over here? As we just saw earlier, we are going to expand this method, and we have this ex plus f, but rather than toiling with this general approach further, I can teach you exactly how to apply this method for three factors or four factors. </div>

What you will have to do is three multiplied by one is three and into two is six, so you've got the coefficient of x three. The next is x two. When will you get x two When you multiply two terms having x. </div>

You get this. We got the coefficient of x two. Now, what we did is we multiplied coefficient of x with another coefficient of x, so that here we are multiplying this x into this x, and you got x two and then you multiply it with the constant term, which does not give any more x, so you remain with the power of two in this case. Let us move a bit further. The next highest power will be x. That is a single x. Let us see how this works. Multiply the coefficient of x in the first bracket with the constant term of second, so three into two is six, and then that with the constant term in the third bracket three into two is six, six into one is six. Then multiply this one that is, coefficient of x in the second bracket, with the constant term of other two brackets. That is one into one is one and then you further multiply it with this one so one into one is again one so add one more. Plus... Coefficient of x is two two multiplied by this constant term will give you two. Sorry, this multiplied by two will give you four, and multiply this further with one. It will give you four. Then the constant term is obtained by multiplying all the constants. That is two into one is two into one is two, so this would be your answer... </div>

This method you can expand till any power of x. Try it for x raised to four and x raised to five for your answer, and just let me know in the comment area if you could get it. If you can't get it, just let me know so that I can create a video to explain you in an even better way. Thank you. </div>
