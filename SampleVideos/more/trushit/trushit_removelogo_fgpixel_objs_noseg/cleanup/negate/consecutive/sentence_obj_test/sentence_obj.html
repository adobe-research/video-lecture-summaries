<tr><td>1.  Trushit Vaishnav In this video we are going to learn how to expand or we can say how to simplify a given set of algebraic factors. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>2.  For example, let us say I am having x minus one into x minus two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000352_000507_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  What would be the usual process for this? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  First of all, I would multiply this x into this x to get x two and I will mention the equal to sign. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000618_000753_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  Then I will multiply this x with this minus two to get minus two x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000855_000990_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  Then I will be multiplying this minus one with this x, to get minus x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001157_001262_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  Then I would multiply this minus one with this minus two to get plus two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001317_001414_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  Later, the next step, x two remains as it is. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001515_001604_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  minus two x and minus x makes minus three x, plus two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001754_001897_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  The process is really easy, and we could do it in a fairly simple way. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  But here, there are only two factors that have to be multiplied, so that we could follow this process. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  But what if we had some three or four factors to multiply? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  Let us say I have one more over here, like say x minus three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002544_002618_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  What I will have to do is, I will have to put a bracket over here, and I will have to continue multiplying these corresponding things, which actually means that I will have to reach through the step, and then I will have to perform similar operations with these two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002684_002996_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  Now, here there were only two terms in one bracket and another two terms in another bracket. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  Here we are having three terms in the first bracket, and two terms in the latter. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  You will see that, as we move down, as the number of factors increases, the number of terms that has to be multiplied also goes up. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  This makes things really complicated. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  There is an easy way to avoid this hassle. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  Let us see how. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  Here, let us generalize this entire process first. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  We will first derive our results and then see how this pattern actually works. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  First of all, your first factor is in the form of ax plus b, and another is in the form of cx plus d, and a third one is in the form of ex plus f. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004672_004933_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  But these three factors, we can derive our results, and we can expand this method, even if you are having say four or five factors, or even any number of factors. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  First, I will deal with this part. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005388_005488_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  So, ax into cx is equal to acx two and ax into d is adx, plus b into cx is bcx, plus b into d. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005679_006159_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  This forms first bracket, and multiply it by ex plus f. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_006288_006523_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  Fine. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  Now, simplifying this further, I will get acx two plus, taking x common, ad plus bc plus bd. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_006648_007165_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  Then I get ex plus f. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007171_007272_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  Now, this thing you need to remember. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  I will stop over here, and this is a really quick way to obtain the simplified form of multiplication of two factors. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007492_007562_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  Let's say I have two x plus one into five x plus three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_007827_008033_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  Rather than multiplying things correspondingly, what I can do is, a into c. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  Let's look at this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  What is a into c? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  It is a coefficient of x, and c is also a coefficient of x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008302_008375_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  What we want is x two. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  In this general form, you can see that when we are multiplying two factors, both of them having x, the highest power will be x two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008668_008793_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  What would be its coefficient? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  Multiplying its corresponding coefficients of five into two is ten. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_008969_008990_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  Fine, ten plus next lower power would be x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_009089_009200_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  Now, you can update x, ad plus bc. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  What is a into this term, plus b into this term? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  A is a coefficient of x, multiplied by its constant part that is the part that does not have variable along with it of the second bracket, plus the constant part of the first bracket, multiplied by the part which is the coefficient of the variable in the second bracket. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  Take the coefficient of x, that is a, into d. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  Let's apply it over here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  Coefficient of x is two multiplied by three, so you get six. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_010211_010232_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  Then take the coefficient of x on this bracket, so it's five and multiply it with one so this is it. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_010407_010573_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  Then b into c. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_010611_010628_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  What is b? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  A constant part over here, and... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>53.  sorry, it's b into d. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_010850_010876_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>54.  What is b into d? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>55.  Constant part over here, and constant part over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011004_011030_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>56.  We just change the color, the constant part over here and the constant part over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011167_011188_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>57.  That is b into d. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>58.  It does not have any coefficient... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>59.  it does not have x along with it, or I can say it is x to power of zero. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011471_011506_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>60.  As you can see, it is power of one. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011566_011581_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>61.  So, b into d, and it is three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011710_011725_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>62.  This should be the simplified form of this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011820_011911_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>63.  Let us do it with our usual method, two x plus one multiplied by five x plus three, the ten x two plus six x plus five x plus three, which is equal to ten x two plus six plus five is eleven x, plus this is a plus sign plus three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_011938_012673_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>64.  As you can see, we can simplify this further as ten x two plus six plus five eleven x, plus three, and x to the zero is one. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_012712_012872_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>65.  You're getting both same answer, but this method is really efficient. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>66.  Now, you might be wondering if every time you have to write this general form. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>67.  You really don't need to. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>68.  Let us see how it works, even when you don't write the general form, or you don't go through this above mentioned generic process. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>69.  If you have a number like five x minus one and three x plus two, remember that here it is negative. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_013500_013915_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>70.  Here there are two factors, so highest power will be squared, and there will be some coefficient of it. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_014114_014285_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>71.  It will be five into three, fifteen. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_014370_014397_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>72.  Then, next power will be x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_014544_014562_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>73.  What will be its coefficient? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_014658_014668_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>74.  five that is coefficient of x in the first bracket, and the constant part in the second is five into two is ten. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_014912_014940_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>75.  Then, constant part of first bracket, multiplied by the coefficient of x in second, it is minus three because here it's minus one. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_015122_015133_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>76.  Put addition sign over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_015179_015286_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>77.  Plus... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>78.  now you have to multiply the two constant parts, minus one into two. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>79.  That is minus two so what we get is one five x two ten minus three seven x, minus two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_015618_015952_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>80.  Just verify yourself with your usual procedure and you will end up with the same answer. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_016014_016050_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>81.  What if we have one more term over here? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>82.  As we just saw earlier, we are going to expand this method, and we have this ex plus f, but rather than toiling with this general approach further, I can teach you exactly how to apply this method for three factors or four factors. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_016391_016413_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>83.  I'm not going to expand it any further because we are here to simplify things, and not to complicate it any more. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>84.  Let us understand direct approach. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>85.  Let's say I have three x plus one x plus two and two x plus one. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_017265_017591_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>86.  These are the three factors that I have, and I want to multiply them. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>87.  When we are multiplying three factors, each of them having one x, one thing is certain that the highest power you're going to get is x three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_017999_018037_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>88.  How can you obtain x three Multiply this term into this term, and into this term. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_018099_018257_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>89.  What you will have to do is three multiplied by one is three and into two is six, so you've got the coefficient of x three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_018567_018727_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>90.  The next is x two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_018766_018800_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>91.  When will you get x two When you multiply two terms having x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_018806_018812_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>92.  Here, there is three and here there is one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>93.  So, three into one is three and then you multiply that term with this one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>94.  Remember this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>95.  Multiply coefficient of x of first bracket with that of coefficient of x of the second, which is one in this case, and then multiply that product with the constant part in the third bracket, so three into one is three and further you multiply it with one you get three. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_019451_019873_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>96.  Plus... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>97.  Then you multiply coefficient of x from first bracket with that of third. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_020327_020462_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>98.  That is, you get six three into two is six and then multiply that with the constant part of the second. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_020467_020612_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>99.  three into two is six, and six into two is one two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_020700_020780_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>100.  Then you multiply the coefficient of x, in this case one in the second bracket with that of the third bracket, so that's one into two is two and then multiply that with the constant part in the first bracket, so one into two is two and two into one is two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_021135_021422_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>101.  You get this. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_021528_021535_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>102.  We got the coefficient of x two. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>103.  Now, what we did is we multiplied coefficient of x with another coefficient of x, so that here we are multiplying this x into this x, and you got x two and then you multiply it with the constant term, which does not give any more x, so you remain with the power of two in this case. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_022119_022148_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>104.  Let us move a bit further. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_022228_022250_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>105.  The next highest power will be x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_022316_022361_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>106.  That is a single x. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>107.  Let us see how this works. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>108.  Multiply the coefficient of x in the first bracket with the constant term of second, so three into two is six, and then that with the constant term in the third bracket three into two is six, six into one is six. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_023055_023069_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>109.  Then multiply this one that is, coefficient of x in the second bracket, with the constant term of other two brackets. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_023088_023107_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>110.  That is one into one is one and then you further multiply it with this one so one into one is again one so add one more. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_023553_023564_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>111.  Plus... </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>112.  Coefficient of x is two two multiplied by this constant term will give you two. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>113.  Sorry, this multiplied by two will give you four, and multiply this further with one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>114.  It will give you four. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_024010_024033_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>115.  Then the constant term is obtained by multiplying all the constants. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_024078_024101_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>116.  That is two into one is two into one is two, so this would be your answer... </td>
<td><img src= "obj_024274_024381_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>117.  one two thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen eleven, plus two. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_024588_024766_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>118.  This is the expansion, I can say. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>119.  Isn't it simple, that you don't ever try and multiply things. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>120.  You simply add up a few numbers and multiply some small numbers. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_025055_025078_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>121.  This method you can expand till any power of x. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>122.  Try it for x raised to four and x raised to five for your answer, and just let me know in the comment area if you could get it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>123.  If you can't get it, just let me know so that I can create a video to explain you in an even better way. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>124.  Thank you. </td>
