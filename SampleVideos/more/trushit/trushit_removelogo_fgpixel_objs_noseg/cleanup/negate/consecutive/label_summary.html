<h1>Algebra: Quick way of simplification and expansion </h1><br><div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Trushit Vaishnav In this video we are going to learn how to expand or we can say how to simplify a given set of algebraic factors. </div>

<p><b>(a)</b> For example, let us say I am having x minus one into x minus two. </p><p><b>(b)</b> What would be the usual process for this? First of all, I would multiply this x into this x to get x two and I will mention the equal to sign. </p></div>

<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
The process is really easy, and we could do it in a fairly simple way. But here, there are only two factors that have to be multiplied, so that we could follow this process. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line0_sub4.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>But what if we had some three or four factors to multiply? Let us say I have one more over here, like say x minus three. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line1_sub4.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>What I will have to do is, I will have to put a bracket over here, and I will have to continue multiplying these corresponding things, which actually means that I will have to reach through the step, and then I will have to perform similar operations with these two. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">

<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Now, here there were only two terms in one bracket and another two terms in another bracket. Here we are having three terms in the first bracket, and two terms in the latter. You will see that, as we move down, as the number of factors increases, the number of terms that has to be multiplied also goes up. This makes things really complicated. There is an easy way to avoid this hassle. Let us see how. Here, let us generalize this entire process first. We will first derive our results and then see how this pattern actually works. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line3_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> First of all, your first factor is in the form of ax plus b, and another is in the form of cx plus d, and a third one is in the form of ex plus f. </p><p><b>(b)</b> But these three factors, we can derive our results, and we can expand this method, even if you are having say four or five factors, or even any number of factors. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line4_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>First, I will deal with this part. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line5_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> So, ax into cx is equal to acx two and ax into d is adx, plus b into cx is bcx, plus b into d. </p><p><b>(b)</b> This forms first bracket, and multiply it by ex plus f. </p><p><b>(c)</b> Fine. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line6_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> Now, simplifying this further, I will get acx two plus, taking x common, ad plus bc plus bd. </p><p><b>(b)</b> Then I get ex plus f. </p><p><b>(c)</b> Now, this thing you need to remember. </p></div>
</div>

<img src= "label_summary/line7_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>I will stop over here, and this is a really quick way to obtain the simplified form of multiplication of two factors. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">

<img src= "label_summary/line8_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>Let's say I have two x plus one into five x plus three. </p><p>Rather than multiplying things correspondingly, what I can do is, a into c. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Let's look at this. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line3_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>What is a into c? It is a coefficient of x, and c is also a coefficient of x. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
What we want is x two. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line8_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>In this general form, you can see that when we are multiplying two factors, both of them having x, the highest power will be x two. </p></div>

<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line9_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> What would be its coefficient? Multiplying its corresponding coefficients of five into two is ten. </p><p><b>(b)</b> Fine, ten plus next lower power would be x. </p><p><b>(c)</b> Now, you can update x, ad plus bc. </p><p>What is a into this term, plus b into this term? A is a coefficient of x, multiplied by its constant part that is the part that does not have variable along with it of the second bracket, plus the constant part of the first bracket, multiplied by the part which is the coefficient of the variable in the second bracket. </p><p>Take the coefficient of x, that is a, into d. </p><p>Let's apply it over here. </p><p><b>(d)</b> Coefficient of x is two multiplied by three, so you get six. </p></div>

<p><b>(a)</b> it does not have x along with it, or I can say it is x to power of zero. </p><p><b>(b)</b> As you can see, it is power of one. </p><p><b>(c)</b> So, b into d, and it is three. </p></div>

<p>This should be the simplified form of this. </p></div>

<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line11_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>Let us do it with our usual method, two x plus one multiplied by five x plus three, the ten x two plus six x plus five x plus three, which is equal to ten x two plus six plus five is eleven x, plus this is a plus sign plus three. </p></div>

<p>As you can see, we can simplify this further as ten x two plus six plus five eleven x, plus three, and x to the zero is one. </p></div>

<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
You're getting both same answer, but this method is really efficient. Now, you might be wondering if every time you have to write this general form. You really don't need to. </div>

<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>Let us see how it works, even when you don't write the general form, or you don't go through this above mentioned generic process. </p><p>If you have a number like five x minus one and three x plus two, remember that here it is negative. </p></div>

<p><b>(a)</b> Here there are two factors, so highest power will be squared, and there will be some coefficient of it. </p><p><b>(b)</b> It will be five into three, fifteen. </p><p><b>(c)</b> Then, next power will be x. </p><p><b>(d)</b> What will be its coefficient? five that is coefficient of x in the first bracket, and the constant part in the second is five into two is ten. </p><p><b>(e)</b> Then, constant part of first bracket, multiplied by the coefficient of x in second, it is minus three because here it's minus one. </p><p><b>(f)</b> Put addition sign over here. </p><p><b>(g)</b> Plus... </p><p><b>(h)</b> now you have to multiply the two constant parts, minus one into two. </p></div>

<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line14_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

<p>What if we have one more term over here? As we just saw earlier, we are going to expand this method, and we have this ex plus f, but rather than toiling with this general approach further, I can teach you exactly how to apply this method for three factors or four factors. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
I'm not going to expand it any further because we are here to simplify things, and not to complicate it any more. Let us understand direct approach. </div>

Here, there is three and here there is one. So, three into one is three and then you multiply that term with this one. Remember this. </div>

<p>Multiply coefficient of x of first bracket with that of coefficient of x of the second, which is one in this case, and then multiply that product with the constant part in the third bracket, so three into one is three and further you multiply it with one you get three. </p></div>

This method you can expand till any power of x. Try it for x raised to four and x raised to five for your answer, and just let me know in the comment area if you could get it. If you can't get it, just let me know so that I can create a video to explain you in an even better way. Thank you. </div>
