0:00[D. Evans] Let's get started with programming.
0:02Programming is really the core of computer science.
0:05Most machines are designed to do just one thing.
0:08This is supposed to be a toaster.
0:11It's more of a representational drawing than an accurate one.
0:14A toaster - well, we can do more than one thing with a toaster maybe.
0:18We can put different things in it.
0:20We can toast bread, we can toast muffins.
0:22Maybe it has some things we can use to change its behavior a little bit.
0:26We can turn a setting to make it toast for longer or shorter.
0:30But it's pretty limited what it can do.
0:32Everything it can do is a variation on this basic functionality that it was designed for,
0:36this basic process of putting toast in, heating it up, and getting the toast to pop out.
0:42If we want to change its behavior to do something really different,
0:45we'd have to physically alter the machine.
0:48We could maybe take the parts out, put them together in a new way.
0:51If we're really creative we could make a bicycle from the toaster.
0:54That would be a pretty big project, though.
0:57So without a program, a computer is even less useful than a toaster.
1:00Can't do anything without a program.
1:02The program is what tells the computer what to do.
1:05And the power of a computer is that, unlike a toaster,
1:08which is really designed to only do a few things,
1:10a computer can do anything.
1:12A computer is a universal machine.
1:14We can program it to do essentially any computation.
1:17So anything that we can imagine,
1:19anything that we can figure out how to write a program for,
1:21we can make the computer do.
1:23And what the program needs to be is a very precise sequence of steps.
1:27The computer by itself doesn't know how to do anything.
1:30It has a few simple instructions that it can execute.
1:33And to make a program do something useful,
1:35we need to put those instructions together in a way that does what we want.
1:38So we can turn the computer into a web browser, into a server,
1:42into a game-playing machine, into a toaster without anywhere to put the bread,
1:48but into anything that we can imagine - at least any computation we want to do.
1:52And the power of the computer is that it can execute those steps super, super fast,
1:56so we can execute billions of instructions in one second.
2:00The program gives us a way to tell the computer what steps to take.
2:04There are many different languages for programming computers.
2:07The language we're going to learn in this course is a language called Python, like the snake.
2:11It's also named after Monty Python.
2:14The important thing about Python is it gives us a nice high level language
2:18that we can use to write programs.
2:20And that means instead of our program running directly on the computer,
2:23the programs that we write will be an input to the Python program,
2:26which runs on the computer.
2:28What Python is is called an interpreter.
2:30That means it runs our programs, it interprets them,
2:33executes the program that we wrote in the Python language
2:36by running a program in the language that the computer can understand directly.
