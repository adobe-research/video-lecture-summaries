0:07Amanda Sudan so can't stop
0:11cancers where you have uncontrolled proliferation of cells that arise from
0:16virtually
0:17any type of cell in the body so basically you can have both cell skin
0:22cells got souls and they can all develop and become
0:25cancer cells the word cancer itself comes from the Greek word Park in Omaha
0:31which means crap hence the horoscope stuff the
0:35people who are born intensa also has a crime simple
0:38let us look in the example
0:42can so that may occur in that colour or in the
0:46up our lives test times so here I am sure the large intestines or also
0:52referred to as the colon
0:53these red mushy looking things represent schumer
0:56schumer refers to
0:59some for love you growth when dealing with can select schumer's is better to
1:05refer to schumer's
1:07as New York laser which means
1:10new growth but either way
1:13Schumer and your place you're mean the same thing which means new growth
1:17but in this video I would use the word choose more water than your pleasure
1:22now cancer is a type of Chima
1:27that usually grows rapidly but not always
1:30some schumer's are slow-growing such as
1:34ones that occurred Las another fundamental thing to take
1:40is that the term can stop refers to a malignant schumer
1:45and not a benign tumor but what is a difference between
1:49a malignant share a number 91 well let's have a closer look at the college
1:54miss your and see if we can differentiate so here we have a section
2:00of the colon
2:00this
2:04sure here let's just say will represent a benign schumer
2:08now a benign tumor is slow-growing
2:11it is relatively localize and
2:14has a well-defined capsule so it doesn't really
2:18break all it's there it also
2:21I'll the Colin actually has a blood
2:24a blood supply under innovation here shown here
2:28of course a benign sure is not very dangerous
2:32but as it grows can increase in severity because
2:35it can stop pressing against nerve fibers for example and
2:39temperatures pain but other than that but nine schumer's
2:44are not Kansas now let's look at a malignancy
2:51which can start of Paris small but
2:55acid rose this is your tea up increases
2:59drastically it Schumer
3:02is need is malignant tumor is not contained and can start digging
3:06under ni the layers of tissues like so
3:09and during this time that Schumer were purchased chemicals
3:14though cause surrounding blood vessels to grow
3:17and so big schumer's often have
3:20massive blood supply to be
3:23the growing need so
3:26the Libyan schumer is characterized are
3:30by first avoids cancers
3:34it grows rapidly its on Capp slated
3:37at it consists of different types of cells cause a very sweet asians
3:42up their car and of course when I mean a malignant schumer
3:48I mean living in Childress can also break all travel to
3:52other areas or other organs in the body and cause she miss their
3:57so it's very dangerous so benign
4:01not so dangerous believe it very dangerous so off to a different topic
4:07let's look at some commonly diagnosed cancers so here I am drawing a lot
4:13because the lung
4:14I'll lung cancer the second or third most common diagnosed cancers in male
4:19and females
4:20and this is because 1 there are many smokers in the world
4:25and two when cancer spreads from somewhere
4:29from one area in the body usually spreads to the loans
4:32first so for females the most commonly diagnosed cancers are breast lung and
4:39colorectal
4:40colorectal means anywhere either colon or rectal area
4:43or med the most commonly diagnosed cancer prostate lung and colorectal
4:49now the current five-year survival rate for 60 percent
4:54after a cancer diagnosis means that people are living
4:59and this is great hopefully in the near future
5:02they will be improve treatment interventions are well
5:06whole people with cancer sue Butler
5:10and conflict
5:15now this little bit more about the path official pith have the physiology and
5:19progression up Tessa
5:21so we're looking at a malignant Schumer
