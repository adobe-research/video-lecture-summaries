No. You just apply the fundamental theorem of calculus, and it's actually a very straightforward and a very fast thing to do. Now let's mix it up a little bit. </p><figure>

Well the recognition here is that this is capital-- capital F of x was defined as this. Now instead of an x, you have an x squared. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_003342_003357_group_001876_001984.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001243_003357_group.png'" >So this is the exact same thing as taking the derivative with respect to x of capital F of-- not x. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be this. Instead, we have capital F of x squared. Where we had an x here before, we now have an x squared. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_003342_003357_group_002074_002095.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001243_003357_group.png'" >You can verify. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you had capital F of x squared, every place where you saw the x here would be an x squared. So it would look exactly like this. And so we just have to apply the chain rule. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_003342_003357_group_002331_002332.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001243_003357_group.png'" >So this is going to be equal to the derivative of F with respect to x squared. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;And this is just straight out of the chain rule. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_003342_003357_group_002483_002694.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001243_003357_group.png'" >It's going to be F prime of x squared times the derivative with respect to x of x squared. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the derivative of F with respect to x squared and then times the derivative of x squared with respect to x. This is just the chain rule right over here. So what's F prime of x squared-- the derivative of F with respect to x squared? Well, if you evaluate F prime at x squared, instead of just being cotangent squared of x, it's going to be cotangent squared of x squared. <a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_003342_003357_group_003054_003112.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001243_003357_group.png'" >So this part right over here, this business right over here, is going to be cotangent squared of x squared. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#" onmouseover="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/highlight/obj_003342_003357_group_003136_003357.png'" onmouseout="document.getElementById('fig1').src='line_figures_v2/obj_001243_003357_group.png'" >So this is the derivative of all of this business with respect to x squared, and then you have to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x, which is just 2x. </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;So there you have it. </p><figure>
