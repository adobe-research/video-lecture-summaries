<tr><td>1.  Let's say that we have capital F of x as being equal to the definite integral from pi to x of cotangent squared of t dt. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>2.  And what we're curious about finding is the derivative of this business. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  We want to figure out what F prime of x is equal to. </td>

</td>

<tr><td>4.  Well this is a direct application of the fundamental theorem of calculus. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  This is just going to be the derivative with respect to x of all of this craziness. </td>

</td>

<tr><td>6.  So let me just copy and paste that. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  So it's just going to be the derivative with respect to that. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  And the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this is going to be equal to just this function, but it's not going to be a function of t anymore. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000704_000727_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  It's going to be a function of x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000733_000748_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  So it's going to be equal to cotangent squared of x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000786_000842_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  And you'll often see problems like this if you go to calculus competitions or things like that and, or maybe certain exams. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000881_000899_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  And It's like, oh my god, I have to take the antiderivative of all of this business, evaluate it at the different boundaries, and then I got to take the derivative. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  No. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  You just apply the fundamental theorem of calculus, and it's actually a very straightforward and a very fast thing to do. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  Now let's mix it up a little bit. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  Let's say that you had the expression the definite integral from pi-- instead of from pi to x, let's say it's from pi to x squared-- and let me write that x squared in a different color just to make it clear what I'm doing-- from pi to x squared of cotangent squared of t dt. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001243_001551_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  And you wanted to take the derivative of this business. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  So you want to take the derivative with respect to x of this business. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001652_001683_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  How would you do it? Well the recognition here is that this is capital-- capital F of x was defined as this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  Now instead of an x, you have an x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  So this is the exact same thing as taking the derivative with respect to x of capital F of-- not x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001876_001984_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  That would be this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  Instead, we have capital F of x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  Where we had an x here before, we now have an x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  You can verify. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002074_002095_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  If you had capital F of x squared, every place where you saw the x here would be an x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  So it would look exactly like this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  And so we just have to apply the chain rule. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  So this is going to be equal to the derivative of F with respect to x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002331_002332_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  And this is just straight out of the chain rule. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  It's going to be F prime of x squared times the derivative with respect to x of x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002483_002694_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  This is the derivative of F with respect to x squared and then times the derivative of x squared with respect to x. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  This is just the chain rule right over here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  So what's F prime of x squared-- the derivative of F with respect to x squared? Well, if you evaluate F prime at x squared, instead of just being cotangent squared of x, it's going to be cotangent squared of x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  So this part right over here, this business right over here, is going to be cotangent squared of x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003054_003112_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  So this is the derivative of all of this business with respect to x squared, and then you have to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x, which is just 2x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003136_003357_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  So there you have it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  The derivative of this, all this craziness, is equal to 2x cotangent squared of x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003399_003476_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
