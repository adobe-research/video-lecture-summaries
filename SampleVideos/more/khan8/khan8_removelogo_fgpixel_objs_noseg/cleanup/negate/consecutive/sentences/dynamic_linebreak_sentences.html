Let's say that we have capital F of x as being equal to the definite integral from pi to x of cotangent squared of t dt.

And what we're curious about finding is the derivative of this business.

We want to figure out what F prime of x is equal to.

Well this is a direct application of the fundamental theorem of calculus.

This is just going to be the derivative with respect to x of all of this craziness.

So let me just copy and paste that. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
So it's just going to be the derivative with respect to that. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
And the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this is going to be equal to just this function, but it's not going to be a function of t anymore.

And you'll often see problems like this if you go to calculus competitions or things like that and, or maybe certain exams.

<tr><td><p>
And It's like, oh my god, I have to take the antiderivative of all of this business, evaluate it at the different boundaries, and then I got to take the derivative. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
No. 
</p></td>
<td></td>

<tr><td><p>
You just apply the fundamental theorem of calculus, and it's actually a very straightforward and a very fast thing to do. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
Now let's mix it up a little bit. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
Let's say that you had the expression the definite integral from pi-- instead of from pi to x, let's say it's from pi to x squared-- and let me write that x squared in a different color just to make it clear what I'm doing-- from pi to x squared of cotangent squared of t dt. 
</p></td>

<tr><td><p>
And you wanted to take the derivative of this business. 
</p></td>
<td></td>

<tr><td><p>
So you want to take the derivative with respect to x of this business. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_001683_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

<tr><td><p>
How would you do it? Well the recognition here is that this is capital-- capital F of x was defined as this. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
Now instead of an x, you have an x squared. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So this is the exact same thing as taking the derivative with respect to x of capital F of-- not x. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_001984_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
That would be this. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
Instead, we have capital F of x squared. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
Where we had an x here before, we now have an x squared. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
You can verify. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_002095_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

<tr><td><p>
If you had capital F of x squared, every place where you saw the x here would be an x squared. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So it would look exactly like this. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
And so we just have to apply the chain rule. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So this is going to be equal to the derivative of F with respect to x squared. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_002332_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
And this is just straight out of the chain rule. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
It's going to be F prime of x squared times the derivative with respect to x of x squared. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_002694_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
This is the derivative of F with respect to x squared and then times the derivative of x squared with respect to x. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
This is just the chain rule right over here. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So what's F prime of x squared-- the derivative of F with respect to x squared? Well, if you evaluate F prime at x squared, instead of just being cotangent squared of x, it's going to be cotangent squared of x squared. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So this part right over here, this business right over here, is going to be cotangent squared of x squared. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_003112_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<figcaption>  </figcaption>
</figure>
</br></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
So this is the derivative of all of this business with respect to x squared, and then you have to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x, which is just 2x. 
</p></td>
<td><figure>
<img src= "obj_001243_003357_group.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">

</figure>
</br></td>

<tr><td><p>
So there you have it. 
</p></td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td><p>
The derivative of this, all this craziness, is equal to 2x cotangent squared of x squared.
