<p>
 Let's say that we have capital F of x as being equal to the definite integral from pi to x of cotangent squared of t dt..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000133_000304.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And what we're curious about finding is the derivative of this business..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We want to figure out what F prime of x is equal to..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Well this is a direct application of the fundamental theorem of calculus..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000340_000416.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is just going to be the derivative with respect to x of all of this craziness..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000428_000461.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let me just copy and paste that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's just going to be the derivative with respect to that..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000496_000546.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that this is going to be equal to just this function, but it's not going to be a function of t anymore..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000644_000713.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000715_000779.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's going to be a function of x..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's going to be equal to cotangent squared of x..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000783_000825.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >

<p>
 And you'll often see problems like this if you go to calculus competitions or things like that and, or maybe certain exams..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000878_001055.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And It's like, oh my god, I have to take the antiderivative of all of this business, evaluate it at the different boundaries, and then I got to take the derivative..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 No..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You just apply the fundamental theorem of calculus, and it's actually a very straightforward and a very fast thing to do..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001071_001148.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now let's mix it up a little bit..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's say that you had the expression the definite integral from pi-- instead of from pi to x, let's say it's from pi to x squared-- and let me write that x squared in a different color just to make it clear what I'm doing-- from pi to x squared of cotangent squared of t dt..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001222_001310.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001313_001345.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001435_001464.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001477_001612.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And you wanted to take the derivative of this business..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So you want to take the derivative with respect to x of this business..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001640_001712.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 How would you do it? Well the recognition here is that this is capital-- capital F of x was defined as this..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001723_001846.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now instead of an x, you have an x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001851_001915.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is the exact same thing as taking the derivative with respect to x of capital F of-- not x..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001942_001998.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 That would be this..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_002001_002015.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Instead, we have capital F of x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Where we had an x here before, we now have an x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_002043_002174.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You can verify..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you had capital F of x squared, every place where you saw the x here would be an x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it would look exactly like this..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And so we just have to apply the chain rule..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_002264_002341.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is going to be equal to the derivative of F with respect to x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And this is just straight out of the chain rule..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's going to be F prime of x squared times the derivative with respect to x of x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_002471_002526.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_002535_002718.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is the derivative of F with respect to x squared and then times the derivative of x squared with respect to x..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is just the chain rule right over here..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So what's F prime of x squared-- the derivative of F with respect to x squared? Well, if you evaluate F prime at x squared, instead of just being cotangent squared of x, it's going to be cotangent squared of x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this part right over here, this business right over here, is going to be cotangent squared of x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_003040_003115.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_003123_003216.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is the derivative of all of this business with respect to x squared, and then you have to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x, which is just 2x..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_003263_003317.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_003340_003367.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So there you have it..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The derivative of this, all this craziness, is equal to 2x cotangent squared of x squared..
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_003377_003489.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
