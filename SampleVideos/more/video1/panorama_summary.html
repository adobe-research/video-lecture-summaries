We are going to prove some formulas from Trigonometry, directly from Euler's formula, e to the i x equals cosine x plus i sine x First, we are going to prove that sine to the two x plus cos to the two x equals one This can be proven from the Pythagorean theorem and the definitions of the trigonometric functions, but we are going to do it using Euler's formula. 
</p><p>
First, use the fact that e to the i x, we know that's cosine x plus i.sine 
</p><p>
x We also use the fact that, we've got e to the minus i x equals e to the iminus x that's the same thing as cosine minus x plus i.sinminus 
</p><p>
x Furthermore, since cos is an even function, cosine minus x equals cosine x and since sine is an odd function, sinminus x is minus sinx We write the negative out in front of the i Next, we are going to multiply together these two equations right here. 
</p><p>
We have e to the i x e to the minus i x equals cosine minus x plus i.sinminus 
</p><p>
x cosine x minus i.sine 
</p><p>
x Now, on the left hand side, add the same base, these exponents we will add them together, get zero for an x by e to the zero is one. 
</p><p>
On the right hand side, multiplying together the first two terms, we get cos to the two x multiplying together the outside terms, we get minus i.cosine 
</p><p>
x sine x then multiplying together the inside terms, we are going to get a plus i.sine 
</p><p>
x cosine x Finally, multiplying together the two last terms, we are going to get a minus i to the two sine to the two x Now, there is some great cancellation which happens, these two terms cancel out, and this minus i to the two i to the two is minus one, minus minus one is positive one. 
</p><p>
What we are left with is one equals cos to the two x plus sine to the two x which was exactly what we hoped to get up above. 
</p><p>
That's just the first way you can use Euler's formula to come up with a more algebraic proof, prove a few more results similarly. 
</p><p>
For instance, I'd like to prove the Angle Sum formulas, a hard time remembering these sometimes but that's a great reason to remember where formulas came from, and you can always reminus derive them for yourself. 
</p><p>
First, say we have e to the i a equals cosine a plus i.sine 
</p><p>
a also say we have e to the ib equals cosine b plus i sine b Now, just like before, we'll take these two equations and multiply them together e to the ia e to the ib equals cosine a plus i sine a cosine b plus i sinb On the left, it's simplified e to the ia plus b, on the right, we'll get cosine a cosine b plus we are going to multiply together the two last terms here, i to the two is negative one, so, minus sine a sinb multiplying the interior terms, in the exterior terms, both can have a factor of i, cosine a sinb we are going to write the i on the outside, now factoring that out, we have a sine a cosine b Next, I am going to take Euler's formula and apply it directly to e to the ia plus b equals cosine a plus b plusequals i.sine 
</p><p>
a plus b Now, interesting thing, when two complex numbers are equal, their real in their imaginary parts must also be equal, the real part, this first term is cos a plus b which matches up with this part here, and the imaginary part is sine a plus b which must therefore be equal to this part. 
</p><p>
If we write down these two results, we have the angle sum formulas. 
</p><p>
cos a plus b equals cosine a cosine b minus sine a sinb and we get the sum formula for sine as well, sine a plus b equals cosine a sinb plus sine a cosine b Furthermore, if you want to get the double angle formulas, that's not too bad, if you let a equals x and b equals x then you will get cos twox that's x plus x equals cosine x. 
</p><p>
cosine x is cosine to the two x sine x. 
</p><p>
Sine x minus sine to the two x and sine two x We are going to have cosine x sine x plus sine x cosine x both those terms are actually the same, so, you get twosinx cosine x Once more, Euler's formula proves to be a handy tool to have.
