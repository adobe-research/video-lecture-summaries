<p>
 Let's take the derivative with respect to x of x to the n plus 1-th power over n plus 1 plus some constant c.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000020_003056.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And we're going to assume here, because we want this expression to be defined, we're going to assume that n does not equal negative 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000264_003347.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If it equaled negative 1, we'd be dividing by 0, and we haven't defined what that means.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's take the derivative here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is going to be equal to-- well, the derivative of x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1, we can just use the power rule over here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So our exponent is n plus 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We can bring it out front.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So it's going to be n plus 1 times x to the-- I want to use that same color.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Colors are the hard part-- times x to the-- instead of n plus 1, we subtract 1 from the exponent.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is just the power rule.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So n plus 1 minus 1 is going to be n.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we can't forget that we were dividing by this n plus 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So we have divided by n plus 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we have plus c.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The derivative of a constant with respect to x-- a constant does not change as x changes, so it is just going to be 0, so plus 0.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And since n is not equal to negative 1, we know that this is going to be defined.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is just going to be something divided by itself, which is just going to be 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And this whole thing simplifies to x to the n.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So the derivative of this thing-- and this is a very general terms-- is equal to x to the n.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So given that, what is the antiderivative-- let me switch colors here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001441_004277.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 What is the antiderivative of x to the n? And remember, this is just the kind of strange-looking notation we use.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It'll make more sense when we start doing definite integrals.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But what is the antiderivative of x to the n? And we could say the antiderivative with respect to x, if we want to.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And another way of calling this is the indefinite integral.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Well, we know this is saying x to the n is the derivative of what? Well, we just figured it out.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's the derivative of this thing, and we've written it in very general terms.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We're actually encapsulating multiple constants here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We could have x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus 0, plus 1, plus 2, plus pi, plus a billion.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is going to be equal to x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus c.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is pretty powerful.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You can kind of view this as the reverse power rule.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And it applies for any n, as long as n does not equal negative 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let me make that very clear.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 n does not equal negative 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Once again, this thing would be undefined if n were equal to negative 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's do a couple of examples just to apply this-- you could call it the reverse power rule if you want, or the anti-power rule.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's take the antiderivative of x to the fifth power.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 What is the antiderivative of x to the fifth? Well, all we have to say is, well, look, the 5 is equal to the n.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We just have to increment the exponent by 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is going to be equal to x to the 5 plus 1 power.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we divide by that same value.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Whatever the exponent was when you increment it by 1, we divide by that same value, divided by 5 plus 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And of course, we want to encapsulate all of the possible antiderivatives, so you put the c right over there.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is going to be equal to x to the sixth over 6 plus c.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And you can verify.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Take the derivative of this using the power rule, you indeed get x to the fifth.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's try another one.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's try-- now we'll do it in blue.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's try the antiderivative of-- let's make it interesting.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's make it 5 times x to the negative 2 power dx.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So how would we evaluate this? Well, one simplification you can do-- and I haven't rigorously proven it to you just yet-- but we know that scalars can go in and out of the derivative operator when you're multiplying by a scalar.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is, indeed, equal to 5 times the antiderivative of x to the negative 2 power, dx.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And now we can just use, I guess we could call it this anti-power rule, so this is going to be equal to 5 times x to the negative 2 power plus 1 over the negative 2 power plus 1 plus some constant right over here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we can rewrite this as 5 times negative 2 power plus 1 is x to the negative 1 over negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1, plus some constant.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And this is equal to 5 times negative x to the negative 1 plus some constant.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then if we want, we can distribute the 5.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is equal to negative 5x to the negative 1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Now, we could write plus 5 times some constant, but this is just an arbitrary constant.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is still just an arbitrary constant.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So maybe we could [INAUDIBLE] this.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 If you want it to show that it's a different constant, you could say this is c1, c1, c1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 You multiply 5 times c1, you get another constant.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We could just call that c, which is equal to 5 times c1.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But there you have it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Negative 5x to the negative 1 plus c.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And once again, all of these, try to evaluate the derivative, and you will see that you get this business, right over there.
