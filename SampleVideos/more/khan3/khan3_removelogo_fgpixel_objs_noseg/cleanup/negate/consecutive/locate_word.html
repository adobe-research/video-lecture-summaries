<p>
Let's take the derivative with respect to x of x to the n plus 1-th power over n plus 1 plus some constant c. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we're going to assume <font color='red'>here, </font>because we want this expression to be defined, we're going to assume that n does not equal negative 1. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc1_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If it equaled negative 1, we'd be dividing by 0, and we haven't defined what that means. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's take the derivative <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc3_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to-- well, the derivative of x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1, we can just use the power rule over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc4_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So our exponent is n plus 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We can bring it out front. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So it's going to be n plus 1 times x to the-- I want to use that same color. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Colors are the hard part-- times x to the-- instead of n plus 1, we subtract 1 from the exponent. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is just the power rule. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So n plus 1 minus 1 is going to be n. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we can't forget that we were dividing by this n plus 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So we have divided by n plus 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we have plus c. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The derivative of a constant with respect to x-- a constant does not change as x changes, so it is just going to be 0, so plus 0. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And since n is not equal to negative 1, we know that this is going to be defined. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is just going to be something divided by itself, which is just going to be 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And this whole thing simplifies to x to the n. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So the derivative of this thing-- and this is a very general terms-- is equal to x to the n. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So given that, what is the antiderivative-- let me switch colors <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc19_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
What is the antiderivative of x to the n? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And remember, this is just the kind of strange-looking notation we use. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It'll make more sense when we start doing definite integrals. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But what is the antiderivative of x to the n? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we could say the antiderivative with respect to x, if we want to. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And another way of calling this is the indefinite integral. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, we know this is saying x to the n is the derivative of what? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, we just figured it out. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's the derivative of this thing, and we've written it in very general terms. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We're actually encapsulating multiple constants <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc29_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We could have x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus 0, plus 1, plus 2, plus pi, plus a billion. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus c. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is pretty powerful. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You can kind of view this as the reverse power rule. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And it applies for any n, as long as n does not equal negative 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let me make that very clear. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
n does not equal negative 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Once again, this thing would be undefined if n were equal to negative 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's do a couple of examples just to apply this-- you could call it the reverse power rule if you want, or the anti-power rule. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's take the antiderivative of x to the fifth power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
What is the antiderivative of x to the fifth? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, all we have to say is, well, look, the 5 is equal to the n. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We just have to increment the exponent by 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to x to the 5 plus 1 power. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we divide by that same value. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Whatever the exponent was when you increment it by 1, we divide by that same value, divided by 5 plus 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And of course, we want to encapsulate all of the possible antiderivatives, so you put the c right over there. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to x to the sixth over 6 plus c. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And you can verify. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Take the derivative of this using the power rule, you indeed get x to the fifth. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's try another one. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's try-- now we'll do it in blue. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's try the antiderivative of-- let's make it interesting. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's make it 5 times x to the negative 2 power dx. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So how would we evaluate this? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, one simplification you can do-- and I haven't rigorously proven it to you just yet-- but we know that scalars can go in and out of the derivative operator when you're multiplying by a scalar. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is, indeed, equal to 5 times the antiderivative of x to the negative 2 power, dx. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And now we can just use, I guess we could call it this anti-power rule, so this is going to be equal to 5 times x to the negative 2 power plus 1 over the negative 2 power plus 1 plus some constant right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc57_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we can rewrite this as 5 times negative 2 power plus 1 is x to the negative 1 over negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1, plus some constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And this is equal to 5 times negative x to the negative 1 plus some constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then if we want, we can distribute the 5. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is equal to negative 5x to the negative 1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Now, we could write plus 5 times some constant, but this is just an arbitrary constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is still just an arbitrary constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So maybe we could [INAUDIBLE] this. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
If you want it to show that it's a different constant, you could say this is c1, c1, c1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
You multiply 5 times c1, you get another constant. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We could just call that c, which is equal to 5 times c1. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But there you have it. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Negative 5x to the negative 1 plus c. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And once again, all of these, try to evaluate the derivative, and you will see that you get this business, right over there. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
