<tr><td>1.  Let's take the derivative with respect to x of x to the n plus 1-th power over n plus 1 plus some constant c. </td>

</td>

<tr><td>2.  And we're going to assume here, because we want this expression to be defined, we're going to assume that n does not equal negative 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000262_000292_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  If it equaled negative 1, we'd be dividing by 0, and we haven't defined what that means. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  So let's take the derivative here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  So this is going to be equal to-- well, the derivative of x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1, we can just use the power rule over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000403_000411_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  So our exponent is n plus 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000518_000536_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  We can bring it out front. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000547_000574_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  So it's going to be n plus 1 times x to the-- I want to use that same color. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000585_000669_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  Colors are the hard part-- times x to the-- instead of n plus 1, we subtract 1 from the exponent. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000761_000775_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  This is just the power rule. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  So n plus 1 minus 1 is going to be n. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000860_000868_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  And then we can't forget that we were dividing by this n plus 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000890_000902_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  So we have divided by n plus 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000921_000955_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  And then we have plus c. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  The derivative of a constant with respect to x-- a constant does not change as x changes, so it is just going to be 0, so plus 0. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001092_001112_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  And since n is not equal to negative 1, we know that this is going to be defined. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001176_001203_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  This is just going to be something divided by itself, which is just going to be 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001229_001252_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  And this whole thing simplifies to x to the n. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001260_001315_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  So the derivative of this thing-- and this is a very general terms-- is equal to x to the n. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  So given that, what is the antiderivative-- let me switch colors here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  What is the antiderivative of x to the n? </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001524_001608_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  And remember, this is just the kind of strange-looking notation we use. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001647_001667_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  It'll make more sense when we start doing definite integrals. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  But what is the antiderivative of x to the n? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  And we could say the antiderivative with respect to x, if we want to. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  And another way of calling this is the indefinite integral. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001827_001923_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  Well, we know this is saying x to the n is the derivative of what? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  Well, we just figured it out. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  It's the derivative of this thing, and we've written it in very general terms. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  We're actually encapsulating multiple constants here. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  We could have x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus 0, plus 1, plus 2, plus pi, plus a billion. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  So this is going to be equal to x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus c. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002200_002299_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  So this is pretty powerful. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002323_002337_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  You can kind of view this as the reverse power rule. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002350_002410_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  And it applies for any n, as long as n does not equal negative 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002433_002462_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  Let me make that very clear. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002495_002545_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  n does not equal negative 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002569_002578_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  Once again, this thing would be undefined if n were equal to negative 1. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  So let's do a couple of examples just to apply this-- you could call it the reverse power rule if you want, or the anti-power rule. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  So let's take the antiderivative of x to the fifth power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002784_002860_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  What is the antiderivative of x to the fifth? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  Well, all we have to say is, well, look, the 5 is equal to the n. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002934_002965_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  We just have to increment the exponent by 1. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  So this is going to be equal to x to the 5 plus 1 power. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003000_003056_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  And then we divide by that same value. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  Whatever the exponent was when you increment it by 1, we divide by that same value, divided by 5 plus 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003149_003177_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  And of course, we want to encapsulate all of the possible antiderivatives, so you put the c right over there. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003184_003249_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  So this is going to be equal to x to the sixth over 6 plus c. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003270_003347_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  And you can verify. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  Take the derivative of this using the power rule, you indeed get x to the fifth. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  Let's try another one. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  Let's try-- now we'll do it in blue. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>53.  Let's try the antiderivative of-- let's make it interesting. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003514_003524_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>54.  Let's make it 5 times x to the negative 2 power dx. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003580_003679_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>55.  So how would we evaluate this? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>56.  Well, one simplification you can do-- and I haven't rigorously proven it to you just yet-- but we know that scalars can go in and out of the derivative operator when you're multiplying by a scalar. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003848_003874_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>57.  So this is, indeed, equal to 5 times the antiderivative of x to the negative 2 power, dx. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003885_003992_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>58.  And now we can just use, I guess we could call it this anti-power rule, so this is going to be equal to 5 times x to the negative 2 power plus 1 over the negative 2 power plus 1 plus some constant right over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004061_004277_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>59.  And then we can rewrite this as 5 times negative 2 power plus 1 is x to the negative 1 over negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1, plus some constant. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004316_004481_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>60.  And this is equal to 5 times negative x to the negative 1 plus some constant. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004490_004595_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>61.  And then if we want, we can distribute the 5. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>62.  So this is equal to negative 5x to the negative 1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004642_004684_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>63.  Now, we could write plus 5 times some constant, but this is just an arbitrary constant. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004695_004730_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>64.  So this is still just an arbitrary constant. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>65.  So maybe we could [INAUDIBLE] this. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>66.  If you want it to show that it's a different constant, you could say this is c1, c1, c1. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004868_004898_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>67.  You multiply 5 times c1, you get another constant. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004943_004952_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>68.  We could just call that c, which is equal to 5 times c1. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>69.  But there you have it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>70.  Negative 5x to the negative 1 plus c. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005079_005102_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>71.  And once again, all of these, try to evaluate the derivative, and you will see that you get this business, right over there. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_005107_005192_group.png" width="" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
