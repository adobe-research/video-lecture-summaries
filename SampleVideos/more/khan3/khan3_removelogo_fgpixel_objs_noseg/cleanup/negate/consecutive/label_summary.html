<p>Let's take the derivative with respect to x of x to the n plus 1-th power over n plus 1 plus some constant c. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line1_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>And we're going to assume here, because we want this expression to be defined, we're going to assume that n does not equal negative 1. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
If it equaled negative 1, we'd be dividing by 0, and we haven't defined what that means. So let's take the derivative here. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">

<p><b>(a)</b> So this is going to be equal to-- well, the derivative of x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1, we can just use the power rule over here. </p><p><b>(b)</b> So our exponent is n plus 1. </p><p><b>(c)</b> We can bring it out front. </p><p><b>(d)</b> So it's going to be n plus 1 times x to the-- I want to use that same color. </p><p><b>(e)</b> Colors are the hard part-- times x to the-- instead of n plus 1, we subtract 1 from the exponent. </p><p>This is just the power rule. </p><p><b>(f)</b> So n plus 1 minus 1 is going to be n. </p><p><b>(g)</b> And then we can't forget that we were dividing by this n plus 1. </p><p><b>(h)</b> So we have divided by n plus 1. </p><p>And then we have plus c. </p><p><b>(i)</b> The derivative of a constant with respect to x-- a constant does not change as x changes, so it is just going to be 0, so plus 0. </p><p><b>(j)</b> And since n is not equal to negative 1, we know that this is going to be defined. </p><p><b>(k)</b> This is just going to be something divided by itself, which is just going to be 1. </p><p><b>(l)</b> And this whole thing simplifies to x to the n. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So the derivative of this thing-- and this is a very general terms-- is equal to x to the n. So given that, what is the antiderivative-- let me switch colors here. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">

<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> What is the antiderivative of x to the n? And remember, this is just the kind of strange-looking notation we use. </p><p>It'll make more sense when we start doing definite integrals. </p><p>But what is the antiderivative of x to the n? And we could say the antiderivative with respect to x, if we want to. </p><p><b>(b)</b> And another way of calling this is the indefinite integral. </p><p><b>(c)</b> Well, we know this is saying x to the n is the derivative of what? Well, we just figured it out. </p><p>It's the derivative of this thing, and we've written it in very general terms. </p><p>We're actually encapsulating multiple constants here. </p><p>We could have x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus 0, plus 1, plus 2, plus pi, plus a billion. </p><p><b>(d)</b> So this is going to be equal to x to the n plus 1 over n plus 1 plus c. </p><p><b>(e)</b> So this is pretty powerful. </p><p><b>(f)</b> You can kind of view this as the reverse power rule. </p><p><b>(g)</b> And it applies for any n, as long as n does not equal negative 1. </p><p><b>(h)</b> Let me make that very clear. </p><p><b>(i)</b> n does not equal negative 1. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
Once again, this thing would be undefined if n were equal to negative 1. So let's do a couple of examples just to apply this-- you could call it the reverse power rule if you want, or the anti-power rule. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line3_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>So let's take the antiderivative of x to the fifth power. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line2_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>What is the antiderivative of x to the fifth? Well, all we have to say is, well, look, the 5 is equal to the n. </p><p>We just have to increment the exponent by 1. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line3_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> So this is going to be equal to x to the 5 plus 1 power. </p><p>And then we divide by that same value. </p><p><b>(b)</b> Whatever the exponent was when you increment it by 1, we divide by that same value, divided by 5 plus 1. </p><p><b>(c)</b> And of course, we want to encapsulate all of the possible antiderivatives, so you put the c right over there. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line4_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>So this is going to be equal to x to the sixth over 6 plus c. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
And you can verify. Take the derivative of this using the power rule, you indeed get x to the fifth. Let's try another one. Let's try-- now we'll do it in blue. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line5_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> Let's try the antiderivative of-- let's make it interesting. </p><p><b>(b)</b> Let's make it 5 times x to the negative 2 power dx. </p><p><b>(c)</b> So how would we evaluate this? Well, one simplification you can do-- and I haven't rigorously proven it to you just yet-- but we know that scalars can go in and out of the derivative operator when you're multiplying by a scalar. </p><p><b>(d)</b> So this is, indeed, equal to 5 times the antiderivative of x to the negative 2 power, dx. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line6_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>And now we can just use, I guess we could call it this anti-power rule, so this is going to be equal to 5 times x to the negative 2 power plus 1 over the negative 2 power plus 1 plus some constant right over here. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line7_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>And then we can rewrite this as 5 times negative 2 power plus 1 is x to the negative 1 over negative 2 plus 1 is negative 1, plus some constant. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line8_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>And this is equal to 5 times negative x to the negative 1 plus some constant. </p><p>And then if we want, we can distribute the 5. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line9_sub0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p><b>(a)</b> So this is equal to negative 5x to the negative 1. </p><p><b>(b)</b> Now, we could write plus 5 times some constant, but this is just an arbitrary constant. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c0_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c0" class="", width="">
So this is still just an arbitrary constant. So maybe we could [INAUDIBLE] this. </div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">
<img src= "label_summary/line6_sub1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="c2" class="", width="">
<p>If you want it to show that it's a different constant, you could say this is c1, c1, c1. </p></div>
</div>
<div id="c1c2_wrapper" class="", width="">
<div id="c1" class="", width="">

<p><b>(a)</b> You multiply 5 times c1, you get another constant. </p><p>We could just call that c, which is equal to 5 times c1. </p><p>But there you have it. </p><p>Negative 5x to the negative 1 plus c. </p><p><b>(b)</b> And once again, all of these, try to evaluate the derivative, and you will see that you get this business, right over there. </p></div>
