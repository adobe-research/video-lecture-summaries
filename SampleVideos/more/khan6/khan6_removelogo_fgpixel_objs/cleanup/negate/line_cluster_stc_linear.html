 So let's see if we can take the derivative of this expression right over here, if we can find capital F prime of x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And once again, it looks like you might be able to use the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 A big giveaway is that you're taking the derivative of a definite integral that gives you a function of x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But here I have x on both the upper and the lower boundary, and the fundamental theorem of calculus, is at least from what we've seen, is when we have x's only on the upper boundary.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then, of course, it's an x squared, but we've seen examples of that already when we used the chain rule to do it.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But how can we break this up and put this in a form that's a little bit closer to what we're familiar with when we apply the fundamental theorem of calculus? And to realize that, we really just have to attempt to graph what this is representing.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's say that this is our lowercase f of x, or I should say f of t.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's call this lowercase f of t.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And let's graph it over the interval between x and x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So let's say this is my y-axis.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000875_004519.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000891_004234.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 This is my t-axis.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And let's say that this right over here is y is equal to f of t.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_000989_003877.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 I'm drawing it generally.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 I don't know what this exactly looks like.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And we're going to talk about the interval between x and x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So if we're going to talk about the interval between x, which is right over here, it's the lower bound, so x and x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's the lower bound, at least for this definite integral.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We don't know for sure.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It depends on what x you choose on which one is actually smaller.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But let's just say that for the sake of visualizing, we'll draw x right over here, and we will draw x squared right over here.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001469_004458.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<img src= "obj_001469_002047.png" max-width="" usemap="#" id="" >
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this whole expression, this entire definite integral, is essentially asking for, is essentially representing this entire area, the entire area under the curve.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 But what we could do is introduce a constant that's someplace in between x and x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Let's say that constant is c, and break this area into two different areas with c as the divider.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So that same exact whole area we can now write it as two separate integrals.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So one integral that represents this area right over here, and then another integral that represents this area right over there, and where we just say c is some constant between x and x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Well, how can we denote this area in purple? Well, that's going to be-- So this thing is going to be equal to the sum of these two areas.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 The purple area we can show is the definite integral from x to c of our function of t, cosine t over t dt.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then to that we're going to add the green area.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we'll get the original area.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So for the green area, our lower bound of integration is now our constant c, and our upper bound of integration is x squared, and it's going to be of cosine t over t dt.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And this is a form where, if we know how to apply the chain rule, we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And this is almost in a form.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We're used to seeing it where the x is the upper bound.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And, well, we already know what happens.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We can swap these two bounds, but it'll just be the negative of that integral.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So this is going to be equal to-- let me rewrite it-- the negative of the definite integral from c to x of cosine t over t dt.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then we have plus the definite integral that goes from c to x squared of cosine t over t dt.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So all we've done is we've rewritten this thing in a way that we're used to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So if we want to find F prime of x, well, applying the derivative operator over here, we're going to have a negative out front.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 It's going to be equal to negative cosine x over x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Once again, just the fundamental theorem of calculus.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then plus-- we're first going to take the derivative of this thing with respect to x squared, and that's going to give you cosine of x squared over x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 Wherever you saw t, you replace it with an x squared.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And then you're going to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So that's just going to be-- derivative of x squared with respect to x is just 2x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And we're done.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 We just need to simplify this thing.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 So all of this is going to be equal to negative cosine x over x plus-- well, this is going to cancel out with just one of those-- plus 2 cosine x squared over x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And I guess we could simplify it even more as being equal to-- and we can swap these-- everything over x 2 cosine of x squared minus cosine of x.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
<p>
 And we are done.
</p>
</div>
<div id="" class="">
