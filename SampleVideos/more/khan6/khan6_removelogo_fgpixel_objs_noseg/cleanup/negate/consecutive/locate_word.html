<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's see if we can take the derivative of this expression right over <font color='red'>here, </font>if we can find capital F prime of x. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc0_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And once again, it looks like you might be able to use the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
A big giveaway is that you're taking the derivative of a definite integral that gives you a function of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But <font color='red'>here </font>I have x on both the upper and the lower boundary, and the fundamental theorem of calculus, is at least from what we've seen, is when we have x's only on the upper boundary. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc3_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then, of course, it's an x squared, but we've seen examples of that already when we used the chain rule to do it. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But how can we break this up and put this in a form that's a little bit closer to what we're familiar with when we apply the fundamental theorem of calculus? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And to realize that, we really just have to attempt to graph what this is representing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's say that this is our lowercase f of x, or I should say f of t. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's call this lowercase f of t. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And let's graph it over the interval between x and x squared. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So let's say this is my y-axis. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
This is my t-axis. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And let's say that this right over <font color='red'>here </font>is y is equal to f of t. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc12_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I'm drawing it generally. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
I don't know what this exactly looks like. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we're going to talk about the interval between x and x squared. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So if we're going to talk about the interval between x, which is right over <font color='red'>here, </font>it's the lower bound, so x and x squared. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc16_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's the lower bound, at least for this definite integral. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We don't know for sure. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It depends on what x you choose on which one is actually smaller. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But let's just say that for the sake of visualizing, we'll draw x right over <font color='red'>here, </font>and we will draw x squared right over <font color='red'>here. </font>
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc20_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
<img src= "locate_word/stc20_word1.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this whole expression, this entire definite integral, is essentially asking for, is essentially representing this entire area, the entire area under the curve. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
But what we could do is introduce a constant that's someplace in between x and x squared. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Let's say that constant is c, and break this area into two different areas with c as the divider. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So that same exact whole area we can now write it as two separate integrals. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So one integral that represents this area right over <font color='red'>here, </font>and then another integral that represents this area right over there, and where we just say c is some constant between x and x squared. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc25_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, how can we denote this area in purple? 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Well, that's going to be-- So this thing is going to be equal to the sum of these two areas. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
The purple area we can show is the definite integral from x to c of our function of t, cosine t over t dt. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then to that we're going to add the green area. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we'll get the original area. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So for the green area, our lower bound of integration is now our constant c, and our upper bound of integration is x squared, and it's going to be of cosine t over t dt. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And this is a form where, if we know how to apply the chain rule, we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And this is almost in a form. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We're used to seeing it where the x is the upper bound. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And, well, we already know what happens. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We can swap these two bounds, but it'll just be the negative of that integral. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So this is going to be equal to-- let me rewrite it-- the negative of the definite integral from c to x of cosine t over t dt. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then we have plus the definite integral that goes from c to x squared of cosine t over t dt. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So all we've done is we've rewritten this thing in a way that we're used to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So if we want to find F prime of x, well, applying the derivative operator over <font color='red'>here, </font>we're going to have a negative out front. 
</p><img src= "locate_word/stc40_word0.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
It's going to be equal to negative cosine x over x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Once again, just the fundamental theorem of calculus. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then plus-- we're first going to take the derivative of this thing with respect to x squared, and that's going to give you cosine of x squared over x squared. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
Wherever you saw t, you replace it with an x squared. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And then you're going to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So that's just going to be-- derivative of x squared with respect to x is just 2x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we're done. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
We just need to simplify this thing. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
So all of this is going to be equal to negative cosine x over x plus-- well, this is going to cancel out with just one of those-- plus 2 cosine x squared over x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And I guess we could simplify it even more as being equal to-- and we can swap these-- everything over x 2 cosine of x squared minus cosine of x. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
And we are done. 
</p></div>
<div id="" class="", width="">
<p>
