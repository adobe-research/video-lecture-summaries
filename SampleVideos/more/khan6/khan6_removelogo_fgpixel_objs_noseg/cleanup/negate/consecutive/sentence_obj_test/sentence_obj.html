<tr><td>1.  So let's see if we can take the derivative of this expression right over here, if we can find capital F prime of x. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>2.  And once again, it looks like you might be able to use the fundamental theorem of calculus. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3.  A big giveaway is that you're taking the derivative of a definite integral that gives you a function of x. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4.  But here I have x on both the upper and the lower boundary, and the fundamental theorem of calculus, is at least from what we've seen, is when we have x's only on the upper boundary. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>5.  And then, of course, it's an x squared, but we've seen examples of that already when we used the chain rule to do it. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>6.  But how can we break this up and put this in a form that's a little bit closer to what we're familiar with when we apply the fundamental theorem of calculus? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>7.  And to realize that, we really just have to attempt to graph what this is representing. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>8.  So let's say that this is our lowercase f of x, or I should say f of t. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000684_000741_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>9.  So let's call this lowercase f of t. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000752_000794_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>10.  And let's graph it over the interval between x and x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>11.  So let's say this is my y-axis. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000875_000908_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>12.  This is my t-axis. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000928_000954_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>13.  And let's say that this right over here is y is equal to f of t. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_000989_001081_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>14.  I'm drawing it generally. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>15.  I don't know what this exactly looks like. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>16.  And we're going to talk about the interval between x and x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>17.  So if we're going to talk about the interval between x, which is right over here, it's the lower bound, so x and x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001182_001241_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>18.  It's the lower bound, at least for this definite integral. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>19.  We don't know for sure. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>20.  It depends on what x you choose on which one is actually smaller. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>21.  But let's just say that for the sake of visualizing, we'll draw x right over here, and we will draw x squared right over here. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001417_001485_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>22.  So this whole expression, this entire definite integral, is essentially asking for, is essentially representing this entire area, the entire area under the curve. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001491_001672_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>23.  But what we could do is introduce a constant that's someplace in between x and x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>24.  Let's say that constant is c, and break this area into two different areas with c as the divider. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001765_001858_group.png" height="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>25.  So that same exact whole area we can now write it as two separate integrals. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>26.  So one integral that represents this area right over here, and then another integral that represents this area right over there, and where we just say c is some constant between x and x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_001912_002047_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>27.  Well, how can we denote this area in purple? </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>28.  Well, that's going to be-- So this thing is going to be equal to the sum of these two areas. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002168_002171_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>29.  The purple area we can show is the definite integral from x to c of our function of t, cosine t over t dt. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002229_002383_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>30.  And then to that we're going to add the green area. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002412_002419_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>31.  And then we'll get the original area. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>32.  So for the green area, our lower bound of integration is now our constant c, and our upper bound of integration is x squared, and it's going to be of cosine t over t dt. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002508_002703_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>33.  And this is a form where, if we know how to apply the chain rule, we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002736_002740_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>34.  And this is almost in a form. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>35.  We're used to seeing it where the x is the upper bound. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>36.  And, well, we already know what happens. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>37.  We can swap these two bounds, but it'll just be the negative of that integral. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>38.  So this is going to be equal to-- let me rewrite it-- the negative of the definite integral from c to x of cosine t over t dt. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_002956_003152_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>39.  And then we have plus the definite integral that goes from c to x squared of cosine t over t dt. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003177_003319_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>40.  So all we've done is we've rewritten this thing in a way that we're used to applying the fundamental theorem of calculus. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>41.  So if we want to find F prime of x, well, applying the derivative operator over here, we're going to have a negative out front. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003444_003487_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>42.  It's going to be equal to negative cosine x over x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003560_003568_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>43.  Once again, just the fundamental theorem of calculus. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003613_003651_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>44.  And then plus-- we're first going to take the derivative of this thing with respect to x squared, and that's going to give you cosine of x squared over x squared. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_003717_003877_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>45.  Wherever you saw t, you replace it with an x squared. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>46.  And then you're going to multiply that times the derivative of x squared with respect to x. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>47.  So that's just going to be-- derivative of x squared with respect to x is just 2x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004008_004051_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>48.  And we're done. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>49.  We just need to simplify this thing. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>

<tr><td>50.  So all of this is going to be equal to negative cosine x over x plus-- well, this is going to cancel out with just one of those-- plus 2 cosine x squared over x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004126_004334_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>51.  And I guess we could simplify it even more as being equal to-- and we can swap these-- everything over x 2 cosine of x squared minus cosine of x. </td>
<td><img src= "obj_004364_004519_group.png" width="" usemap="#" id="" class="">
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>52.  And we are done. </td>
<td></td>
</tr>
